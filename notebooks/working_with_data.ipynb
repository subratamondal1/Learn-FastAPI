    "```\n",
    "This line imports `DeclarativeBase` from SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapper). `DeclarativeBase` is a new feature in SQLAlchemy 2.0 that provides a base for declarative class definitions.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Base(DeclarativeBase):\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In previous versions of SQLAlchemy, you would typically use `declarative_base()` to create a base class. In SQLAlchemy 2.0, `DeclarativeBase` is the recommended way to create a declarative base class.\n",

    "3. By inheriting from this `Base` class, your model classes gain all the functionality provided by SQLAlchemy's ORM, including the ability to interact with database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This approach allows for better type checking and IDE auto-completion support compared to the older `declarative_base()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In a typical FastAPI + SQLAlchemy application, you would define this `Base` class in a separate file (often named `database.py` or `models/__init__.py`), and then import it in your model definition files."
