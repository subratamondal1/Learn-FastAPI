      "    'sound decision- makers, and thus, called the language of business.',\n",
      " 2: '1.2 MEANING OF ACCOUNTING\\n'\n",
      "    'The Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of '\n",
      "    'Certified Public Accountants formulated the following definition of '\n",
      "    'accounting in 1961:\\n'\n",
      "    '\"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a '\n",
      "    'significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which '\n",
      "    'are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the '\n",
      "    'result thereof.\"\\n'\n",
      "    'As per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. '\n",
      "    'The process of accounting starts by first identifying the events and '\n",
      "    'transactions which are of financial character and then be recorded in the '\n",
      "    'books of account. Continuing with the same example of the telecom '\n",
      "    'company, which needs to capture all transactions (transactions made by '\n",
      "    'the user, raising invoice to the customer, receipt of money, payment '\n",
      "    'towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the individual running the '\n",
      "    'stationery business, would need to record all business transactions.\\n'\n",
      "    'This recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as '\n",
      "    'primary books. Every good record keeping system includes suitable '\n",
      "    'classification of transactions and events as well as their summarisation '\n",
      "    'for ready reference. For example, the telecom company performing '\n",
      "    'thousands of transactions on a daily basis, is not expected to publish '\n",
      "    'all those transactions for the users to be able to make a decision. '\n",
      "    'Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately.\\n'\n",
      "    'After the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to '\n",
      "    'secondary books, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are '\n",
      "    'classified in terms of income, expense, assets and liabilities according '\n",
      "    'to their characteristics and summarised in profit and loss account and '\n",
      "    'balance sheet.\\n'\n",
      "    'Essentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of '\n",
      "    'money. Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling '\n",
      "    'currency of a country, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and '\n",
      "    'like. The transactions and events must have at least in part, financial '\n",
      "    'characteristics. The inauguration of a new branch of a bank is an event '\n",
      "    'without having financial character, while the business disposed of by the '\n",
      "    'branch is an event having financial character. Accounting also interprets '\n",
      "    'the recorded, classified and summarized transactions and events. However, '\n",
      "    'the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present day '\n",
      "    'accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends '\n",
      "    'with interpretation of the results of the financial transactions and '\n",
      "    'events but in the modern world with the diversification of management and '\n",
      "    'ownership, globalization of business and society gaining more interest in '\n",
      "    'the functioning of the enterprises, the importance of communicating the '\n",
      "    'accounting results has increased.\\n'\n",
      "    'Therefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed '\n",
      "    'judgement has also become the part of accounting as defined in the widely '\n",
      "    'accepted definition of accounting, given by the American Accounting '\n",
      "    'Association in 1966 which treated accounting as:\\n'\n",
      "    '\"The process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic '\n",
      "    'information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of '\n",
      "    'accounts.\"\\n'\n",
      "    'In 1970, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) of American Institute of '\n",
      "    'Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) enumerated the functions of '\n",
      "    'accounting as follows:\\n'\n",
      "    '\"The function of accounting is to provide quantitative information, '\n",
      "    'primarily of financial nature, about economic entities, that is needed to '\n",
      "    'be useful in making economic decisions.\"\\n'\n",
      "    'Thus, accounting may be defined as the process of recording, classifying, '\n",
      "    'summarising, analysing and interpreting the financial transactions and '\n",
      "    'communicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such '\n",
      "    'information.\\n'\n",
      "    'The above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger '\n",
      "    'responsibility than to merely do book-keeping. Accountants need to be '\n",
      "    'ready to provide the information ready for the intended users to be able '\n",
      "    'to make economic decisions.',\n",
      " 3: '1.2.1 Procedural aspects of Accounting\\n'\n",
      "    'On the basis of the above definitions, procedure of accounting can be '\n",

       "\"O) 1.1 INTRODUCTION\\nEvery individual performs some kind of economic activity. A salaried person gets salary and spends to buy provisions and clothing, for children's education, construction of house, etc. A sports club formed by a group of individuals, a business run by an individual or a group of individuals, a company running a business in telecom sector, a local authority like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Delhi Development Authority, Governments, either Central or State, all are carrying some kind of economic activities. Not necessarily all the economic activities are run for any individual benefit; such economic activities may create social benefit i.e. benefit for the public, at large. Anyway, such economic activities are performed through 'transactions and events'. Transaction is used to mean 'a business, performance of an act, an agreement' while event is used to mean 'a happening, as a consequence of transaction(s), a result.'\\nExample 1\\nAn individual invests ₹ 2,00,000 for running a stationery business. On 1st January, he purchases goods for  and sells for  during the month of January. He pays shop rent for the month  and finds that still he has goods worth  in hand. The individual performs an economic activity. He carries on a few transactions and encounters with some events. Is it not logical that he will want to know the result of his activity?\\nWe see that the individual, who runs the stationery business, earns a surplus of ₹ 42,000.\\n\\nEarning of ₹ 42,000 surplus is an event; also having the inventories in hand is another event, while purchase and sale of goods, investment of money and payment of rent are transactions.\\nSimilarly, a municipal corporation got government grant ₹ 500 lakhs for adult education; it spent ₹ 250 lakhs for purchasing literacy kits, paid ₹ 200 lakhs to the tutors and is left with a balance of ₹ 50 lakhs. These are also transactions and events.\\nSimilarly, the Central Government raised money through taxes, paid salaries to the employees, and spent on various developmental activities. Whenever receipts of the Government are more than expenses it has surplus, but if expenses are more than receipts it runs in deficit. Here raising money through various sources can be termed as transaction and surplus or deficit at the end of the accounting year can be termed as an event.\\nA telecom company would need to ensure that it is providing the services for its millions of users for post-paid and pre-paid connections. Each activity done by a user (call, message, data usage) results into an economic event. The entity needs to keep appropriate and timely records to be able to collect money from post-paid connection users for the services availed by them. Likewise, the company will need to ensure that pre-paid connection customers are provided the support and the records confirm how much balance still remains to be utilized.\\nSo, everybody wants to keep records of all transactions and events and to have adequate information about the economic activity as an aid to decision-making. Accounting discipline has been developed to serve this purpose as it deals with the measurement of economic\\nactivities involving inflow and outflow of economic resources, which helps to develop useful information for decision-making process.\\nAccounting has universal application for recording transactions and events and presenting suitable information to aid decision-making regarding any type of economic activity ranging from a family function to functions of the national government. But hereinafter we shall concentrate only on business activities and their accounting because the objective of this study material is to provide a basic understanding on accounting for business activities. Nevertheless, it will give adequate knowledge to think coherently of accounting as a field of study for universal application.\\nThe growth of accounting discipline is closely associated with the development of the business world. Thus, to understand accounting as a field of study for universal application, it is best identified with recording of business transactions and communication of financial information about business enterprise to facilitate decision-making. The aim of accounting is to meet the information needs of the rational and sound decision- makers, and thus, called the language of business.\""

      "Text: ****, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: O) 1.1 INTRODUCTION, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Every individual performs some kind of economic activity. A salaried person gets salary and spends to buy provisions and clothing, for children's education, construction of house, etc. A sports club formed by a group of individuals, a business run by an individual or a group of individuals, a company running a business in telecom sector, a local authority like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, Delhi Development Authority, Governments, either Central or State, all are carrying some kind of economic activities. Not necessarily all the economic activities are run for any individual benefit; such economic activities may create social benefit i.e. benefit for the public, at large. Anyway, such economic activities are performed through 'transactions and events'. Transaction is used to mean 'a business, performance of an act, an agreement' while event is used to mean 'a happening, as a consequence of transaction(s), a result.', Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Example 1, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: An individual invests ₹ 2,00,000 for running a stationery business. On 1st January, he purchases goods for  and sells for  during the month of January. He pays shop rent for the month  and finds that still he has goods worth  in hand. The individual performs an economic activity. He carries on a few transactions and encounters with some events. Is it not logical that he will want to know the result of his activity?, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: We see that the individual, who runs the stationery business, earns a surplus of ₹ 42,000., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: , Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Earning of ₹ 42,000 surplus is an event; also having the inventories in hand is another event, while purchase and sale of goods, investment of money and payment of rent are transactions., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Similarly, a municipal corporation got government grant ₹ 500 lakhs for adult education; it spent ₹ 250 lakhs for purchasing literacy kits, paid ₹ 200 lakhs to the tutors and is left with a balance of ₹ 50 lakhs. These are also transactions and events., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Similarly, the Central Government raised money through taxes, paid salaries to the employees, and spent on various developmental activities. Whenever receipts of the Government are more than expenses it has surplus, but if expenses are more than receipts it runs in deficit. Here raising money through various sources can be termed as transaction and surplus or deficit at the end of the accounting year can be termed as an event., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: A telecom company would need to ensure that it is providing the services for its millions of users for post-paid and pre-paid connections. Each activity done by a user (call, message, data usage) results into an economic event. The entity needs to keep appropriate and timely records to be able to collect money from post-paid connection users for the services availed by them. Likewise, the company will need to ensure that pre-paid connection customers are provided the support and the records confirm how much balance still remains to be utilized., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: So, everybody wants to keep records of all transactions and events and to have adequate information about the economic activity as an aid to decision-making. Accounting discipline has been developed to serve this purpose as it deals with the measurement of economic\n",
      "activities involving inflow and outflow of economic resources, which helps to develop useful information for decision-making process., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Accounting has universal application for recording transactions and events and presenting suitable information to aid decision-making regarding any type of economic activity ranging from a family function to functions of the national government. But hereinafter we shall concentrate only on business activities and their accounting because the objective of this study material is to provide a basic understanding on accounting for business activities. Nevertheless, it will give adequate knowledge to think coherently of accounting as a field of study for universal application., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The growth of accounting discipline is closely associated with the development of the business world. Thus, to understand accounting as a field of study for universal application, it is best identified with recording of business transactions and communication of financial information about business enterprise to facilitate decision-making. The aim of accounting is to meet the information needs of the rational and sound decision- makers, and thus, called the language of business., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: ****, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: 1.2 MEANING OF ACCOUNTING, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The Committee on Terminology set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants formulated the following definition of accounting in 1961:, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: \"Accounting is the art of recording, classifying, and summarising in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the result thereof.\", Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: As per this definition, accounting is simply an art of record keeping. The process of accounting starts by first identifying the events and transactions which are of financial character and then be recorded in the books of account. Continuing with the same example of the telecom company, which needs to capture all transactions (transactions made by the user, raising invoice to the customer, receipt of money, payment towards salaries, marketing etc.). Likewise, the individual running the stationery business, would need to record all business transactions., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: This recording is done in Journal or subsidiary books, also known as primary books. Every good record keeping system includes suitable classification of transactions and events as well as their summarisation for ready reference. For example, the telecom company performing thousands of transactions on a daily basis, is not expected to publish all those transactions for the users to be able to make a decision. Surely, those transactions need to be summarized appropriately., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: After the transactions and events are recorded, they are transferred to secondary books, i.e., Ledger. In ledger, transactions and events are classified in terms of income, expense, assets and liabilities according to their characteristics and summarised in profit and loss account and balance sheet., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Essentially the transactions and events are to be measured in terms of money. Measurement in terms of money means measuring at the ruling currency of a country, for example, rupee in India, dollar in U.S.A. and like. The transactions and events must have at least in part, financial characteristics. The inauguration of a new branch of a bank is an event without having financial character, while the business disposed of by the branch is an event having financial character. Accounting also interprets the recorded, classified and summarized transactions and events. However, the above-mentioned definition does not reflect the present day accounting function. According to the above definition, accounting ends with interpretation of the results of the financial transactions and events but in the modern world with the diversification of management and ownership, globalization of business and society gaining more interest in the functioning of the enterprises, the importance of communicating the accounting results has increased., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Therefore, this requirement of communicating and motivating informed judgement has also become the part of accounting as defined in the widely accepted definition of accounting, given by the American Accounting Association in 1966 which treated accounting as:, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: \"The process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgments and decisions by the users of accounts.\", Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: In 1970, the Accounting Principles Board (APB) of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) enumerated the functions of accounting as follows:, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: \"The function of accounting is to provide quantitative information, primarily of financial nature, about economic entities, that is needed to be useful in making economic decisions.\", Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Thus, accounting may be defined as the process of recording, classifying, summarising, analysing and interpreting the financial transactions and communicating the results thereof to the persons interested in such information., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The above definition requires accountants to assume a bigger responsibility than to merely do book-keeping. Accountants need to be ready to provide the information ready for the intended users to be able to make economic decisions., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: 1.2.1 Procedural aspects of Accounting, Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: (ii) Using the financial information., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Generating Financial Information, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Recording - This is the basic function of accounting. All business transactions of a financial character, as evidenced by some documents such as sales bill, pass book, salary slip etc. are recorded in the books of account. Recording is done in a book called \"Journal.\" This book may further be divided into several subsidiary books according to the nature and size of the business. Students will learn how to prepare journal and various subsidiary books in chapter 2., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Classifying - Classification is concerned with the systematic analysis of the recorded data, with a view to group transactions or entries of one nature at one place so as to put information in compact and usable form. The book containing classified information is called \"Ledger\". This book contains on different pages, individual account heads under which, all financial transactions of similar nature are collected. For example, there may be separate account heads for Salaries, Rent, Printing and Stationeries, Advertisement etc. All expenses under these heads, after being recorded in the Journal, will be classified under separate heads in the Ledger. This will help in finding out the total expenditure incurred under each of the above heads. Students will learn how to prepare ledger books in chapter 2., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Summarising - It is concerned with the preparation and presentation of the classified data in a manner useful to the internal as well as the external users of financial statements. This process leads to the preparation of the financial statements., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Analysing - The term 'Analysis' means methodical classification of the data given in the financial statements. The figures given in the financial statements will not help anyone unless they are in a simplified form. For example, all items relating to fixed assets are put at one place while all items relating to current assets are put at another place. It is concerned with the establishment of relationship between the items of the Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet i.e. it provides the basis for interpretation. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Interpreting - This is the final function of accounting. It is concerned with explaining the meaning and significance of the relationship as established by the analysis of accounting data. The recorded financial data is analysed and interpreted in a manner that will\n",
      "enable the end-users to make a meaningful judgement about the financial condition and profitability of the business operations. The financial statement should explain not only what had happened but also why it happened and what is likely to happen under specified conditions., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Communicating - It is concerned with the transmission of summarised, analysed and interpreted information to the end-users to enable them to make rational decisions. This is done through preparation and distribution of accounting reports, which include besides the usual profit and loss account and the balance sheet, additional information in the form of accounting ratios, graphs, diagrams, fund flow statements etc. Students will learn this aspect of financial statements in the later stages of the Chartered Accountancy Course., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The first two procedural stages of the process of generating financial information along with the preparation of trial balance are covered under book-keeping while the preparation of financial statements and its analysis, interpretation and also its communication to the various users are considered as accounting stages.

      "Text: Using the Financial Information, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: There are certain users of accounts. Earlier it was viewed that accounting is meant for the proprietor or owner of the business, but changing social relationships diluted the earlier thinking. Since earlier businesses were simple and not scaled, probably that view could hold true for those., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: It is now believed that besides the owner or the management of the business enterprise, users of accounts include the investors, employees, lenders, suppliers, customers, government and other agencies and the public at large. For example, if an airlines company borrows money from a bank, buys oil from oil companies, sells tickets to the customers, has staff to be paid salaries to, all these group of people and entities are key stakeholders in that airlines business. They would like to know and understand whether the business of the company is going well or there are challenges for the company to run the business. Accounting provides the art of presenting information systematically to the users of accounts., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Accounting data is more useful if it stresses economic substance rather than technical form. Information is useless and meaningless unless it is relevant and material to a user's decision. The information should also be free of any biases. The users should understand not only the financial results depicted by the accounting figures, but also should be able to assess its reliability and compare it with information about alternative opportunities and the past experience. The owners or the management of the enterprise, commonly known as internal users, use the accounting information in an analytical manner to take the valuable decisions for\n",
      "the business. So the information served to them is presented in a manner different to the information presented to the external users. Even the small details which can affect the internal working of the business are given in the management report while financial statements presented to the external users contains key information regarding assets, liabilities and capital which are summarised in a logical manner that helps them in their respective decision-making., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: 1.3 EVOLUTION OF ACCOUNTING AS A SOCIAL SCIENCE, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: History & Development of Accounting, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Accounting finds its roots as early as around 4000 BC, where Egyptians used some form of accounting for their treasuries. The in-charge of treasuries had to send day wise reports to their superiors known as Wazirs and monthly reports were sent to kings. Babylonia, known as the city of commerce, used accounting for business to identify the losses that took place due to frauds and lack of efficiency. Greece used accounting to divide the revenues received among treasuries, maintaining receipts, payments and balance of government financial transactions. Romans used memorandum or daybook where in receipts and payments were recorded. (700 B.C to 400 A.D)., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: China used sophisticated form of government accounting as early as 2000 B.C. Accounting practices in India could be traced back to a period where, Kautilya, a minister in Chandragupta's kingdom wrote a book named Arthashasthra, which also described how accounting records had to be maintained., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Luca Pacioli's, a Franciscan friar (merchant class), book Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportion at Proportionality (Review of Arithmetic and Geometric proportions) in Venice (1494) is considered as the first book on double entry bookkeeping. A portion of this book contains knowledge of business and book-keeping. He used the terms Debit (Dr.) and Credit (Cr.) in his books. These were the concepts used in Italian terminology. Debit comes from the Italian debito which comes from the Latin debita and debeo which means owed to the proprietor. Credit comes from the Italian credito which comes from the Latin 'credo' which means trust or belief (in the proprietor or owed by the proprietor., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: In explaining double entry system, Pacioli wrote that 'All entries... have to be double entries, that is if you make one creditor, you must make some debtor'. He also mentioned that a merchant's responsibility is to give glory to God in their enterprises, to be ethical in all business activities and to earn a profit. He discussed the details of memorandum, journal, ledger and specialised accounting procedures., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: In its oldest form, accounting aided the stewards to discharge their stewardship function. The wealthy men employed stewards to manage their property; the stewards in turn rendered an account periodically of their stewardship. This 'Stewardship Accounting' was the root of financial accounting system. Although double-entry system was followed, 'stewardship accounting' served the purpose of businessmen and wealthy persons at that time. In most of the countries, stewardship accounting was prevalent till the emergence of large-scale enterprises in the form of public limited companies., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: In the second phase, the idea of financial accounting emerged with the concept of joint stock company and divorce of ownership from the management. To safeguard the interest of the shareholders and investors, disclosure of financial statements (mainly, profit and loss account and balance sheet) and other accounting information was moulded by law. Financial statements give periodic performance report by way of profit and loss account and financial position at the end of the period by way of Balance Sheet. It got the legal status due to changing relationships between the owners, economic entity and the managers. With the democratisation of society, the relationships between the enterprise on the one hand, the investors, employees, managers and governments on the other, have also undergone a seachange. Also, the prospective investors and other business contact groups want to know a lot about the business before entering into transactions. Thus, financial accounting emerged as an information system to identify, measure and communicate useful information for informed judgements and decisions by a broad group of users. In the third phase, accounting information was generated to aid management decision- making in particular. It contributed a lot to improve the quality of management decisions. This new dimension of accounting is called Management Accounting and it is the development of 20th Century only. It is pervasive enough to cover all spheres of management decisions., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Lastly, Social Responsibility Accounting is in the formative process, which aims at accounting for the social cost incurred by business as well as the social benefit, created by it. It emerges from the growing social awareness about the undesirable by-products of economic activities. While earning profit, an enterprise incurs numerous social costs like pollution, using the resources of society like materials, land, labour etc. To compensate for this social cost, in today's world, an enterprise is expected to generate some social benefits also like employment opportunities, recreation activities, more choice to customers at reasonable price, better quality products etc. Therefore, it is demanded that the accounting system should produce a report measuring the social cost incurred and social benefits generated., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Social Science study man as a member of society; they concern about social processes and the results and consequences of social relationships. The usefulness of accounting to society as a whole is the fundamental criterion to treat it as a social science. Although individuals may\n",
      "benefit from the availability of accounting information, the accounting system generates information for social good. It serves social purpose, it contributes for social progress; also it is being adapted to keep pace with social progress. So, accounting is treated as a social science., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: (O) 1.4 OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The objectives of accounting can be given as follows:, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Systematic recording of transactions - Basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions, i.e., book-keeping. These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Ascertainment of results of above recorded transactions - Accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the results of business operations for a particular period of time. If revenue (Sales) exceeds expenses then it is said that business is running profitably but if expenses exceed revenue, then it can be said that business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affair can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Ascertainment of the financial position of the business - A businessman is not only interested in knowing the results of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement popularly known as Balance Sheet. The balance sheet is a statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Providing information to the users for rational decision-making - Accounting as a 'language of business' communicates the financial results of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: To know the solvency position - By preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern's ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: (a) Measurement: Accounting measures past performance of the business entity and depicts its current financial position., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (b) Forecasting: Accounting helps in forecasting future performance and financial position of the enterprise using past data and analysing trends., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (c) Decision-making: Accounting provides relevant information to the users of accounts to aid rational decision-making., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (d) Comparison & Evaluation: Accounting assesses performance achieved in relation to targets and discloses information regarding accounting policies and contingent liabilities which play an important role in predicting, comparing and evaluating the financial results., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (e) Control: Accounting also identifies weaknesses of the operational system and provides feedbacks regarding effectiveness of measures adopted to check such weaknesses., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (f) Government Regulation and Taxation: Accounting provides necessary information to the government to exercise control on the entity as well as in collection of tax revenues., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: 1.6 BOOK-KEEPING, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Book-keeping is an activity concerned with the recording of financial data relating to business operations in a significant and orderly manner. It covers procedural aspects of accounting work and embraces record keeping function. Obviously, book-keeping procedures are governed by the end product, the financial statements. The term 'financial statements' means Profit and Loss Account, Balance Sheet and cash flow statements including Schedules and Notes forming part of Accounts., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Book-keeping also requires suitable classification of transactions and events. This is also determined with reference to the requirement of financial statements. A book-keeper may be responsible for keeping all the records of a business or only of a minor segment, such as position of the customers' accounts in a departmental store. Accounting is based on a careful and efficient book-keeping system., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The essential idea behind maintaining book-keeping records is to show correct position regarding each head of income and expenditure. A business may purchase goods on credit as well as in cash. When the goods are bought on credit, a record must be kept of the person to whom money is owed. The proprietor of the business may like to know, from time to time, what amount is due on credit purchase and to whom. If proper record is not maintained, it is not possible to get details of the transactions in regard to the income and expenses. At the end of the accounting period, the proprietor wants to know how much profit has been earned or loss has been incurred during the course of the period. For this lot of information is needed which can be gathered from a proper record of the transactions. Therefore, in book-keeping, the proper maintenance of books of account is indispensable for any business., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: At this level, the major concern of the curriculum is with book-keeping and preparation of financial statements. It seems important to mention at this point that book-keeping and preparation of financial statements have legal implications also. Maintenance of books of accounts and the preparation of financial statements of a company are guided by the Companies Act, banks and insurance companies by special Acts governing these institutions and so on. However, for sole-proprietorship and partnership business, there is no specific legislation regarding maintenance of books of accounts and preparation of financial statements., Style: Normal\n",

It primarily helps in determination of the net result for an accounting period and the financial position as on the given date., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (ii) Management Accounting - It is concerned with internal reporting to the managers of a business unit. To discharge the functions of stewardship, planning, control and decision- making, the management needs variety of information. The different ways of grouping information and preparing reports as desired by managers for discharging their functions are referred to as management accounting. A very important component of the management accounting is cost accounting which deals with cost ascertainment and cost control. Management Accounting will be dealt with at higher levels of the Chartered Accountancy Course., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: 1.9 USERS OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Generally users of accounts are classified into two categories, (a) internal users and (b) external users. Management accounting is concerned with identifying information requirements as well as methods of providing such information to management while information requirements of the outside users are generally served by financial statements. Following are the various users of accounting information:\n",
      "(i) Investors: They provide risk capital to the business. They need information to assess whether to buy, hold or sell their investment. Also they are interested to know the ability of the business to survive, prosper and to pay dividend. In non-corporate sector, where ownership and management are not essentially separated, the owners still need information about performance of the business and its financial position to decide whether to continue or shut down., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (ii) Employees: Growth of the employees is directly related to the growth of the organisation and therefore, they are interested to know the stability, continuity and growth of the enterprise and its ability to provide remuneration, retirement and other benefits and to enhance employment opportunities., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (iii) Lenders: They are interested to know whether their loan-principal and interest will be paid back when due., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (iv) Suppliers and Creditors: They are also interested to know the ability of the enterprise to pay their dues, that helps them to decide the credit policy for the relevant concern, rates to be charged and so on. Sometimes, they also become interested in long-term continuation of the enterprise if their existence becomes dependent on the survival of that business., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (v) Customers: Customers are also concerned with the stability and profitability of the enterprise because their functioning is more or less dependent on the supply of goods, suppose, a company produces some chemicals used by pharmaceutical companies and supplies chemicals on three month's credit. If all of a sudden it faces some trouble and is unable to supply the chemical, the customers will also be in trouble., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (vi) Government and their agencies: They regulate the functioning of business enterprises for public good, allocate scarce resources among competing enterprises, control prices, charge excise duties and taxes, and so they have continued interest in the business enterprise., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (vii) Public: The public at large is interested in the functioning of the enterprise because it may make a substantial contribution to the local economy in many ways including the number of people employed and their patronage to local suppliers., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (viii) Management: Management as whole is also interested in the accounts for various managerial decisions. On the basis of the accounts, management determines the effects of their various decisions on the functioning of the organisation. This helps them to make further managerial decisions., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: 1.10 RELATIONSHIP OF ACCOUNTING WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Accounting is closely related with several other disciplines and thus to acquire a good knowledge in accounting one should be conversant with the relevant portions of such disciplines. In many cases they overlap accounting. The accountant should have a working knowledge of the related disciplines so that he can understand such overlapping areas and apply the knowledge of other disciplines in his own work wherever possible, or he can take the expert advice., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (a) Accounting and Economics: Economics is viewed as a science of rational decisionmaking about the use of scarce resources. It is concerned with the analysis of efficient use of scarce resources for satisfying human wants. This may be viewed either from the perspective of a single firm or of the country as a whole., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Accounting is viewed as a system, which provides data to the users to permit informed judgement and decisions. Some non-accounting data are also relevant for decisionmaking., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Accounting overlaps economics in many respects. It contributed a lot in improving the management decision-making process. But, economic theories influenced the development of the decision-making tools used in accounting., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: However, there exists a wide gulf between economists' and accountants' concepts of income and capital. Accountants got the ideas of value, income and capital maintenance from economists, but brushed suitably to make them usable in practical circumstances. Accountants developed the valuation, measurement and decisionmaking techniques which may owe to the economic theorems for origin but these are moulded in the work environment and suitably tempered with reference to relevance, verifiability, freedom from bias, timeliness, comparability, reliability and understandability., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: An example may be given to explain the nexus between accounting and economics. Economists think that value of an asset is the present value of all future earnings which can be derived from such assets. Now think about a plant whose working life is more than one hundred years. How can you estimate future stream of earnings? So accountants developed the workable valuation base - the acquisition cost i.e., the price paid to acquire the assets., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: At the macro-level, accounting provides the database over which the economic decision models have been developed; micro-level data arranged by the accounting system is summed up to get macro-level database., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Non-overlapping zones of accounting are not negligible. Development of the systems of recording, classifying and summarising transactions and events, harmonising the systems by uniform rules and communicating the data is essentially a non-overlapping area of accounting., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (b) Accounting and Statistics: The use of statistics in accounting can be appreciated better in the context of the nature of accounting records. Accounting information is very precise; it is exact to the last paisa. But, for decision-making purposes such precision is not necessary and hence, the statistical approximations are sought., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: In accounts, all values are important individually because they relate to business transactions. As against this, statistics is concerned with the typical value, behaviour or trend over a period of time or the degree of variation over a series of observations. Therefore, wherever a need arises for only broad generalisations or the average of relationships, statistical methods have to be applied in accounting data., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Further, in accountancy, the classification of assets and liabilities as well as the heads of income and expenditure has been done as per the needs of financial recording to ascertain financial results of various operations. Other types of classification like the geographical and historical ones and ad hoc classification are done depending on the purpose to make such classification meaningful., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Accounting records generally take a short-term view of events and are confined to a year while statistical analysis is more useful if a longer view is taken for the purpose. For example, to fit the trend line a longer period will be required. However, statistical methods do use past accounting records maintained on a consistent basis., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The functional relations showing mathematical relations of one variable with one or more other variables are based on statistical work. These relations are used widely in making cost or price estimates for some estimated future values assigned to the given independent variables. For example, given the functional relation of total cost to the price of an input, the effect of changes in future prices on the cost of production can be calculated., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: In accountancy, a number of financial and other ratios are based on statistical methods, which help in averaging them over a period of time. Several accounting and financial calculations are based on statistical formulae., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Statistical methods are helpful in developing accounting data and in their interpretation. For example, time series and cross-sectional comparison of accounting data is based on statistical techniques. Now- a-days multiple discriminate analysis is popularly used to identify symptoms of sickness of a business firm. Therefore, the study and application of statistical methods would add extra edge to the accounting data.\n",
      "(c) Accounting and Mathematics: Double Entry book-keeping can be converted in algebraic form; in fact the first known book on this subject was part of a treatise on algebra. The fundamental accounting equation will be discussed in detail under 'Dual Aspect Concept' of this chapter., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Knowledge of arithmetic and algebra is a pre-requisite for accounting computations and measurements. Calculations of interest and annuity are the examples of such fundamental uses. While computing depreciation, finding out installments in hirepurchase and instalments payment transactions, calculating amount to be set aside for repayment of loan and replacement of assets and calculating lease rentals, mathematical techniques are frequently used. Accounting data are also presented in ratio form., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: With the advent of the computer, mathematics is becoming a vital part of accounting. Instead of writing accounts in traditional fashion, the transactions and events can be recorded in the matrix form and the rules of matrix algebra can be applied for classifying and summarising data., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Now-a-days statistics and econometric models are largely used for developing decision models for the users of accounts. Also, Operations Research Techniques provide lot of decision models. Since accounting is meant for providing information to the users, to be effective, accounting data should feed the information requirements of such statistical, econometric and operations research models. Understanding mathematics has become a must to grasp the decision models framed by statisticians, econometricians and the O.R. experts., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Presently graphs and charts are being extensively used for communicating accounting information. In addition to statistical knowledge, knowledge in geometry and trigonometry seems to be essential to have a better understanding about the accounting communications system., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (d) Accounting and Law: An economic entity operates within a legal environment. All transactions with suppliers and customers are governed by the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act, the Negotiable Instruments Act, etc. The entity itself is created and controlled by laws. For example, a company is created by the Companies Act and also controlled by Companies Act., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Similarly, every country has a set of economic, fiscal and labour laws. Transactions and events are always guided by laws of the land. Very often the accounting system to be followed has been prescribed by the law. For example, the Companies Act has prescribed the format of financial statements for companies., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Banking, insurance and electric supply undertakings may also have to produce financial statements as prescribed by the respective legislations controlling such entities., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: However, legal prescription about the accounting system is the product of developments in accounting knowledge. That is to say, legislation about accounting system cannot be enacted unless there is a corresponding development in the accounting discipline. In that way accounting influences law and is also influenced by law., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (e) Accounting and Management: Management is a broad occupational field, which comprises many functions and encompasses application of many disciplines including those mentioned above. Accountants are well placed in the management and play a key role in the management team. A large portion of accounting information is prepared for management decision-making. Although management relies on other data sources, accounting data are used as basic source documents. In the management team, an accountant is in a better position to understand and use such data. In other words, since an accountant plays an active role in management, he understands the data requirements. So the accounting system can be moulded to serve the management purpose., Style: Normal\n",

      "Text: 1.11 LIMITATIONS OF ACCOUNTING, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: There are certain misconceptions regarding financial statements. A common man presumes that an income statement shows the correct income or loss of the enterprise and that a balance sheet depicts a perfectly true and fair picture of financial standing of that enterprise. It must be recognised that the accounting as a language has its own limitations. The figures of profit or loss generated by the accounting process are subject to various constraints within which the accounting works. The assumptions and conventions, on which the accounting is based, become the limitations of accounting. The financial statements are never free from subjectivity factor as these are largely the outcome of personal judgement of the accountant with regard to the adoption of the accounting policies. Following are certain instances:, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: The factors which may be relevant in assessing the worth of the enterprise don't find place in the accounts as they cannot be measured in terms of money. The Balance sheet cannot reflect the value of certain factors like loyalty and skill of the personnel which may be the most valuable asset of an enterprise these days., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Balance Sheet shows the position of the business on the day of its preparation and not on the future date while the users of the accounts are interested in knowing the position of the business in the near future and also in long run and not for the past date., Style: Normal\n",

Accountants are presently taking active role in company laws and other corporate legislation matters, in taxation laws matters (both direct and indirect) and in general management problems. Some of the services rendered by accountants to the society are briefly mentioned hereunder:, Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (i) Maintenance of Books of Accounts: An accountant is able to maintain a systematic record of financial transactions in order to establish the net result of the transactions entered into during a period and to state the financial position of the concern as at a particular date., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: For the fulfillment of the twin objective of ascertaining the profit earned or loss suffered and the financial position, it is necessary that all transactions be recorded in a systematic manner, which can be done only by an accountant. Proper maintenance of books of accounts assists management in planning, decision-making, controlling functions., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (ii) Statutory Audit: Every limited company is required to appoint a chartered accountant or a firm of chartered accountants as their auditor who are statutorily required to report each year whether in their opinion the balance sheet shows a true and fair view of the state of affairs on the balance sheet date, and the profit and loss account shows a true and fair view of the profit or loss for the year., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Auditing is not confined to the accounts of companies; other organisations may also have their accounts audited, either because the law so requires (for example, the Co-operative Societies Act, the Income-tax Act, etc.) or because the proprietors wisely decided so (for example, a partnership firm or an individual trader)., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (iii) Internal Audit: It is a management tool whereby an internal auditor thoroughly examines the accounting transactions and also the system, according to which these have been recorded with a view to ensure the management that the accounts are being properly maintained and the system contains adequate safeguards to check any leakage of revenue or misappropriation of property or assets and the operations have been carried out in conformity with the plans of management., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: Now-a-days internal auditing has developed as a service to management. The internal auditor constructively contributes in improving the operational efficiency of the business through an independent review and appraisal of all business operations., Style: Normal\n",
      "Text: (iv) Taxation: An accountant can handle taxation matters of a business or a person and he can represent that business or person before the tax authorities and settle the tax liability\n",

      "Text: (c) Business Expansion: As businesses grow in size and complexity and mergers are being considered, accountants are in the forefront in interpreting accounts, making suggestions as to the form of schemes and the fairness of proposals considering cost and financial consequences and generally advising their clients. They also advise on how to set about the problem of borrowing money or whether this is an appropriate method of finance. Accountants can render extremely useful service in connection of negotiations with foreign collaborators., Style: Normal\n",

       "  'value': 'ORIGIN OF AUDITING\\nBefore we get to understand meaning and nature of auditing, let\\'s travel back in time to know about origin of auditing. Auditing has existed even in ancient times in many societies of world including India. The reference to auditing is found in Kautilya\\'s Arthshastra even in  century BC. It talks about fixed accounting year, a process for closure of accounts and audit for the same. Concepts of periodical checking and verification existed even in those times. Even there are references in his monumental work to misstatements in financial statements due to abuse of power. Wasn\\'t he far ahead of his times?\\nThe word \"audit\" originates from Latin word \"audire\" meaning \"to hear\". In medieval times, auditors used to hear the accounts read out to them to check that employees were not careless and negligent. Industrial revolution in Europe led to astronomical expansion in volume of trade and consequently demand of auditors.\\nComing to more recent history, the first Auditor General of India was appointed in British India in 1860 having both accounting and auditing functions. Later on, office of Auditor General was given statutory recognition. Presently, Comptroller and Auditor General of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing government receipts and expenditures.\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established as a statutory body under an Act of Parliament in 1949 for regulating the profession of Chartered Accountancy in the country.'},\n",

The \\tauditor should be independent of entity whose financial statements are subject to \\taudit so that he can form an opinion without being affected by any influence. \\tIndependence increases auditor\\'s ability to act objectively without creeping in of \\tany biases.\\nConsider, for example, a person who requests his brother, a Chartered Accountant,to audit accounts of his proprietary concern and issue a report. Can CA audit accounts of concern in which his brother is sole proprietor? No, he cannot. It is due to the fact that there would be no independence in such a case due to relationship by birth between CA and his brother. He would be subject to influence from his brother.\\nTake another case where a CA has invested in shares of a company. Can he audit \\taccounts of such a company in which he holds shares? The answer is resounding \\tNO. It is due to the fact that by holding shares of the company, his own self-\\tinterest gets involved. His own money is invested in the company and he may not \\tbe able to form judgment independently on the financial statements of the \\tcompany.\\nThe entity whose financial information is examined need not necessarily be profit oriented like in case of a business. It can be a non-profit organization like an NGO or a charitable trust. Audit can be undertaken in respect of any organization be it a small, medium or large. Further, it can be conducted for any entity irrespective of its legal structure i.e. such an entity may be a proprietary concern, a partnership firm, a LLP, a private company, a public company, a society or a trust.\\nThe purpose of audit is to express an opinion on the financial statements.\\nUnderstand that preparation and presentation of financial statements of an entity is responsibility of management of entity. The auditor expresses an opinion on financial statements by means of written audit report.\\nIn doing so, he has to see that financial statements would not mislead anybody by ensuring that: -\\nthe accounts have been drawn up with reference to entries in the books of account;\\nthe entries in the books of account are adequately supported by sufficient and appropriate evidence;\\nnone of the entries in the books of account has been omitted in the process of compilation;\\nthe information conveyed by the statements is clear and unambiguous;\\nthe financial statement amounts are properly classified, described and disclosed in conformity with accounting standards; and\\nthe statement of accounts presents a true and fair picture of the operational results and of the assets and liabilities.\\nAuditing provides assurance. Its basic nature lies in providing assurance to users providing confidence to users of financial statements. Such an assurance lends credibility to financial statements. Audited financial statements provide confidence to users that financial information reflected in financial statements can be relied upon.'},\n",

It draws from diverse subjects including accountancy, law, behavioural science, statistics, economics and financial management and makes use of these subjects. Since audit of financial statements is concerned with financial information, a sound knowledge of accounting principles is a fundamental requirement for an auditor of financial statements to conduct audit and express an opinion. Similarly, good knowledge of business laws and various taxation laws helps auditor to understand financial statements in a better way in accordance with applicable laws.\\nDuring course of audit, auditor has to interact with lot of persons for seeking information and making inquiries. This can be done only if one has knowledge of human behaviour. Auditors use statistical methods to draw samples in a scientific manner. It is not possible for an auditor to check each and every transaction. So, use of statistical methods to draw samples for conducting audit is made.\\nKnowledge of subject like economics helps auditor to be familiar with overall economic environment in which specific business is operating. Financial management deals with issues such as funds flow, working capital management, ratio analysis etc. and an auditor is expected to be knowledgeable about these for applying some of audit procedures and carrying out audit effectively. Besides, knowledge of financial markets comprised in study of financial management is expected from a professional auditor.\\nAuditing and Accounting: Auditing reviews the financial statements which are nothing but a result of the overall accounting process.\\nAuditing and Law: An auditor should have a good knowledge of business laws affecting the entity.\\nAuditing and Economics: Auditor is expected to be familiar with the overall economic environment of the client.\\nAuditing and Behavioural Science: Knowledge of human behaviour is essential for an auditor to effectively discharge his duties.\\nAuditing and Statistics & Mathematics: Auditor is also expected to have the knowledge of statistical sampling for meaningful conclusions and mathematics for verification of inventories.\\nAuditing and Data Processing: EDP auditing in itself is developing as a discipline in itself.\\nAuditing and Financial Management : Auditor is expected to have knowledge about various financial techniques such as working capital management, funds flow, ratio analysis, capital budgeting etc.\\nAuditing and Production: Good auditor is one who understands the client and his business functions such as production, cost system, marketing etc.'},\n",

Absolute assurance is a complete assurance or a guarantee that financial statements are free from material misstatements. However, reasonable assurance is not a complete guarantee. Although it is a high-level of assurance but it is not complete assurance.\\nAudit of financial statements is carried out by the auditor with professional competence and skills in accordance with Standards on Auditing. Audit procedures are applied in accordance with SAs, audit evidence is obtained and evaluated. On basis of that, conclusions are drawn and opinion is formed. It leads to high level of assurance which is called as reasonable assurance but it is not absolute assurance.\\nMisstatements in financial statements can occur due to fraud or error or both. The auditor seeks to obtain reasonable assurance whether financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements caused by fraud or error. He has to see effect of misstatements on financial statements as a whole, in totality.\\nObtaining reasonable assurance that financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements enables the auditor to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\nThe opinion is reported and communicated in accordance with audit findings through a written report as required by Standards on Auditing.

The purpose of an audit is to enhance the degree of confidence of intended users in the financial statements. Users of financial statements may be shareholders, employees, customers, government and regulatory authorities, bankers etc. Enhancing of degree of confidence is achieved by the expression of an opinion by the auditor on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n(Applicable financial reporting framework means a framework adopted in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that is acceptable in view of the nature of the entity and the objective of the financial statements, or that is required by law or regulation.)\\nFor example, in case of companies in India, financial reporting framework is provided under Schedule III of Companies Act,2013.\\n\\nThe following points are included in scope of audit of financial statements: -\\nCoverage of all aspects of entity\\nAudit of financial statements should be organized adequately to cover all aspects of the entity relevant to the financial statements being audited.\\nReliability and sufficiency of financial information\\nThe auditor should be reasonably satisfied that information contained in underlying accounting records and other source data (like bills, vouchers, documents etc.) is reliable and sufficient basis for preparation of financial statements.\\nThe auditor makes a judgment of reliability and sufficiency of financial information by making a study and assessment of accounting systems and internal controls and by carrying out appropriate tests, enquiries and procedures.\\nProper disclosure of financial information\\nThe auditor should also decide whether relevant information is properly disclosed in the financial statements. He should also keep in mind applicable statutory requirements in this regard.\\nIt is done by ensuring that financial statements properly summarize transactions and events recorded therein and by considering the judgments made by management in preparation of financial statements.\\nThe management responsible for preparation and presentation of financial statements makes many judgments in this process of preparing and presenting financial statements. For example, choosing of appropriate accounting policies in relation to various accounting issues like choosing method of charging depreciation on fixed assets or choosing appropriate method for valuation of inventories.\\nThe auditor evaluates selection and consistent application of accounting policies by management; whether such a selection is proper and whether chosen policy has been applied consistently on a period-to-period basis.\\nUnderstand that financial statements of an entity are prepared on historical financial information basis. \"Historical financial information\" means information expressed in financial terms in relation to a particular entity, derived primarily from that entity\\'s accounting system, about economic events occurring in past time periods or about economic conditions or circumstances at points in time in the past.\\nFor example, when purchases and sales are reflected in financial statements of an entity, these are examples of historical financial information. These are about transactions which have occurred in past.\\nSince financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical financial information, it is logical that audit of financial statements is also based upon such historical financial information.

These require different skillsets which may be performed by qualified engineers in their respective fields.\\nAn auditor is not an expert in authentication of documents.

       "  'value': 'INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF AUDIT\\nThe process of audit suffers from certain inbuilt limitations due to which an auditor cannot obtain an absolute assurance that financial statements are free from misstatement due to fraud or error. These fundamental limitations arise due to the following factors: -\\nNature of financial reporting\\nPreparation of financial statements involves making many judgments by management. These judgments may involve subjective decisions or a degree of uncertainty. Therefore, auditor may not be able to obtain absolute assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatements due to frauds or errors.\\nOne of the premises for conducting an audit is that management acknowledges its responsibility of preparation of financial statements in accordance with applicable financial reporting framework and for devising suitable internal controls. However, such controls may not have operated to produce reliable financial information due to their own limitations.\\nConsider, for example, that management of a company has devised a control that all purchase bills should reflect stamp and signatures of an authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" of the company stating the date and time of receiving goods in premises. It is an example of internal control devised by the company to ensure that only those purchase bills are produced for payment for which goods have been actually received. Now, what happens if concerned accountant and authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" collude. It is a case of overriding of internal controls devised by the company due to collusion between two persons. Such a probable collusion is one of limitations of internal controls itself.'},\n",

He forms his opinion only by testing samples. It is an example of practical limitation on auditor's ability to obtain audit evidence.\\nManagement may not provide complete information as requested by auditor. There is no way by which auditor can force management to provide complete information as may be requested by auditor. In case he is not provided with required information, he can only report. It is an example of legal limitation on auditor's ability to obtain audit evidence.\\nThe management may consist of dishonest and unscrupulous people and may be, itself, involved in fraud. It may be engaged in concealing fraud by designing sophisticated and carefully organized schemes which may be hard to detect by the auditor. It may produce fabricated documents before auditor to lead him to believe that audit evidence is valid. However, in reality, such documents could be fake or non-genuine.\\nWe have already discussed under section on scope of audit that an auditor is not an expert in authentication of documents. Therefore, he may be led to accept invalid audit evidence on the basis of unauthentic documents.\\nIt is quite possible that entity may have entered into some transactions with related parties.

During these two years, he has sought detailed information from management of company regarding various matters. During his thirdyear stint, he chooses to rely upon some information obtained as part of audit procedures of second year.

       "  'value': 'MEANING OF ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT\\n\"Assurance engagement\" means an engagement in which a practitioner expresses a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users other than the responsible party about the outcome of the evaluation or measurement of a subject matter against criteria.\\nIt means that the practitioner gives an opinion about specific information due to which users of information are able to make confident decisions knowing well that chance of information being incorrect is diminished.\\n Elements of an Assurance Engagement\\nFollowing elements comprise an assurance engagement: -\\nA three party relationship involving a practitioner, a responsible party, and intended users\\nAn assurance engagement involves abovesaid three parties. A practitioner is a person who provides the assurance. The term practitioner is broader than auditor. Audit is related to historical information whereas practitioner may provide assurance not necessarily related to historical financial information.\\nA responsible party is the party responsible for preparation of subject matter.\\nIntended users are the persons for whom an assurance report is prepared. These persons may use the report in making decisions.\\nAn appropriate subject matter\\nIt refers to the information to be examined by the practitioner. For example, financial information contained in financial statements while conducting audit of financial statements.\\nSuitable criteria\\nThese refer to benchmarks used to evaluate the subject matter like standards, guidance, laws, rules and regulations.\\nSufficient appropriate evidence\\nThe practitioner performs an assurance engagement to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence. It is on the basis of evidence that conclusions are arrived and an opinion is formed by auditor.\\n\"Sufficient\" relates to quantity of evidence obtained by auditor. \"Appropriate\" relates to quality of evidence obtained by auditor. One evidence may be providing more comfort to auditor than the other evidence. The evidence providing more comfort is qualitative and, therefore, appropriate. Evidence should be both sufficient and appropriate.\\nA written assurance report in appropriate form\\nA written report is provided containing conclusion that conveys the assurance about the subject matter. A written assurance report is the outcome of an assurance engagement.\\nOverview of Elements of assurance engagement\\n- An assurance engagement involves a three-party relationship consisting of the responsible party, the practitioner, and the intended users.\\n- The subject matter of an assurance engagement must be appropriate, meaning it is capable of evaluation against suitable criteria and available for the practitioner to obtain evidence.\\n- Suitable criteria are standards or benchmarks applied to the subject matter of the assurance engagement against which the practitioner evaluates the information.\\n- Sufficient appropriate evidence is necessary to support the practitioner\\'s conclusion and is obtained through the assurance engagement process.\\n- A written assurance report is provided in an appropriate form to communicate the conclusion of the assurance engagement to its intended users.'},\n",

       "  'value': 'Meaning of Review; Audit Vs. Review\\nWe have learnt that audit is a reasonable assurance engagement. It provides reasonable assurance. However, review is a limited assurance engagement. It provides lower level of assurance than audit. Further, review involves fewer procedures and gathers sufficient appropriate evidence on the basis of which limited conclusions can be drawn up. However, both \"audit\" and \"review\" are related to financial statements prepared on the basis of historical financial information.'},\n",
       " {'key': 19,\n",
       "  'value': 'Types of Assurance Engagements- Reasonable assurance engagement vs. Limited assurance engagement\\nAs already discussed, assurance engagements provide assurance to users. The difference is of degree. Reasonable assurance engagement like audit provides reasonable assurance which is a high level of assurance. Limited assurance engagement like review provides lower level of assurance than audit. It is only a moderate level of assurance.\\n- Reasonable assurance engagement is a process that provides a high level of assurance through the performance of extensive procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence.\\n- In contrast, limited assurance engagement offers a lower level of assurance, performing fewer procedures than a reasonable assurance engagement.\\n- A reasonable assurance engagement results in conclusions based on the adequacy of the evidence gathered during the process.\\n- An example of reasonable assurance engagement is an audit, which involves a thorough examination and provides a high level of assurance.\\n- Conversely, an example of limited assurance engagement is a review, which provides a moderate level of assurance and involves less detailed procedures.\\nBesides reasonable assurance engagements and limited assurance engagements, there is another kind of assurance which is related to matters other than historical financial information. Such an assurance may relate to prospective financial information and not to historical financial information. It may relate to providing assurance on internal controls in an entity.\\n\"Prospective financial information\" means financial information based on assumptions about events that may occur in the future and possible actions by an entity. It can be in the form of a forecast or projection or combination of both.\\nIt is to be noted that in such type of assurance engagements, examination is not of historical financial information.\\nHere, it is important to note the difference between \"Historical financial information\" and \"Prospective financial information.\" The former relates to information expressed in financial terms of an entity about economic events, conditions or circumstances occurring in past periods. The latter relates to financial information based on assumptions about occurrence of future events and possible actions by an entity.\\nTherefore, historical financial information is rooted in past events which have already occurred whereas prospective financial information is related to future events.\\nIn assurance reports involving prospective financial information, the practitioner obtains sufficient appropriate evidence to the effect that management\\'s assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based are not unreasonable, the prospective financial information is properly prepared on the basis of the assumptions and it is properly presented and all material assumptions are adequately disclosed.\\nProspective financial information relates to future events. While evidence may be available to support the assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based, such evidence is itself generally future- oriented. The auditor is, therefore, not in a position to express an opinion as to whether the results shown in the prospective financial information will be achieved.\\nTherefore, in such assurance engagements, practitioner provides a report assuring that nothing has come to practitioner\\'s attention to suggest that these assumptions do not provide a reasonable basis for the projection.\\nHence, such type of assurance engagement provides only a \"moderate\" level of assurance.\\nExamples of assurance engagements\\n- An audit of financial statements is classified as a reasonable assurance engagement, aiming to provide a high assurance level that financial statements are free from material misstatement.\\n- A review of financial statements is considered a limited assurance engagement, which offers a moderate assurance level that no material modifications need to be made to the financial statements.\\n- The examination of prospective financial information is an assurance engagement that assesses the reasonableness of assumptions used in projections and related matters.\\n- Reporting on controls operating at an organization is an assurance engagement that evaluates the design and operation of an organization’s controls.\\nThe various categories of assurance engagements, which are professional services typically provided by certified accountants. The three main branches, originating from the overarching category of \"Assurance Engagements.\" Each branch is detailed below:\\n\\nReasonable Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis branch represents a high level of assurance provided by the auditor or accountant. It bifurcates into one sub-category:\\n\\nAudit: This is a type of reasonable assurance engagement where the auditor expresses an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n\\nLimited Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis type of engagement provides a moderate level of assurance, less than that of a reasonable assurance engagement, but more than the level of assurance that would be provided by a compilation. It has one sub-category:\\n\\nReview: A review engagement is where the accountant performs procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and performing analytical procedures, to express a conclusion that provides a limited level of assurance on the financial statements.\\n\\nAssurance Engagements dealing with matters other than historical financial information:\\n\\nThis branch indicates assurance services that do not focus on historical financial data. It includes:\\n\\nExamination of prospective financial information (like forecast): This involves engagements where auditors evaluate the preparation and presentation of financial forecasts and projections.\\n\\nAssurance regarding operations of controls: Here, the assurance practitioner provides an opinion on the design, implementation, and/or effectiveness of the controls at a service organization.\\n\\nEach of these branches indicates a different scope of work, level of assurance, and purpose within the realm of assurance engagements, offering various options depending on the needs of the users of the financial information.'},\n",

       "  'value': 'ORIGIN OF AUDITING\\nBefore we get to understand meaning and nature of auditing, let\\'s travel back in time to know about origin of auditing. Auditing has existed even in ancient times in many societies of world including India. The reference to auditing is found in Kautilya\\'s Arthshastra even in  century BC. It talks about fixed accounting year, a process for closure of accounts and audit for the same. Concepts of periodical checking and verification existed even in those times. Even there are references in his monumental work to misstatements in financial statements due to abuse of power. Wasn\\'t he far ahead of his times?\\nThe word \"audit\" originates from Latin word \"audire\" meaning \"to hear\". In medieval times, auditors used to hear the accounts read out to them to check that employees were not careless and negligent. Industrial revolution in Europe led to astronomical expansion in volume of trade and consequently demand of auditors.\\nComing to more recent history, the first Auditor General of India was appointed in British India in 1860 having both accounting and auditing functions. Later on, office of Auditor General was given statutory recognition. Presently, Comptroller and Auditor General of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing government receipts and expenditures.\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established as a statutory body under an Act of Parliament in 1949 for regulating the profession of Chartered Accountancy in the country.'},\n",

The \\tauditor should be independent of entity whose financial statements are subject to \\taudit so that he can form an opinion without being affected by any influence. \\tIndependence increases auditor\\'s ability to act objectively without creeping in of \\tany biases.\\nConsider, for example, a person who requests his brother, a Chartered Accountant,to audit accounts of his proprietary concern and issue a report. Can CA audit accounts of concern in which his brother is sole proprietor? No, he cannot. It is due to the fact that there would be no independence in such a case due to relationship by birth between CA and his brother. He would be subject to influence from his brother.\\nTake another case where a CA has invested in shares of a company. Can he audit \\taccounts of such a company in which he holds shares? The answer is resounding \\tNO. It is due to the fact that by holding shares of the company, his own self-\\tinterest gets involved. His own money is invested in the company and he may not \\tbe able to form judgment independently on the financial statements of the \\tcompany.\\nThe entity whose financial information is examined need not necessarily be profit oriented like in case of a business. It can be a non-profit organization like an NGO or a charitable trust. Audit can be undertaken in respect of any organization be it a small, medium or large. Further, it can be conducted for any entity irrespective of its legal structure i.e. such an entity may be a proprietary concern, a partnership firm, a LLP, a private company, a public company, a society or a trust.\\nThe purpose of audit is to express an opinion on the financial statements.\\nUnderstand that preparation and presentation of financial statements of an entity is responsibility of management of entity. The auditor expresses an opinion on financial statements by means of written audit report.\\nIn doing so, he has to see that financial statements would not mislead anybody by ensuring that: -\\nthe accounts have been drawn up with reference to entries in the books of account;\\nthe entries in the books of account are adequately supported by sufficient and appropriate evidence;\\nnone of the entries in the books of account has been omitted in the process of compilation;\\nthe information conveyed by the statements is clear and unambiguous;\\nthe financial statement amounts are properly classified, described and disclosed in conformity with accounting standards; and\\nthe statement of accounts presents a true and fair picture of the operational results and of the assets and liabilities.\\nAuditing provides assurance. Its basic nature lies in providing assurance to users providing confidence to users of financial statements. Such an assurance lends credibility to financial statements. Audited financial statements provide confidence to users that financial information reflected in financial statements can be relied upon.'},\n",

It draws from diverse subjects including accountancy, law, behavioural science, statistics, economics and financial management and makes use of these subjects. Since audit of financial statements is concerned with financial information, a sound knowledge of accounting principles is a fundamental requirement for an auditor of financial statements to conduct audit and express an opinion. Similarly, good knowledge of business laws and various taxation laws helps auditor to understand financial statements in a better way in accordance with applicable laws.\\nDuring course of audit, auditor has to interact with lot of persons for seeking information and making inquiries. This can be done only if one has knowledge of human behaviour. Auditors use statistical methods to draw samples in a scientific manner. It is not possible for an auditor to check each and every transaction. So, use of statistical methods to draw samples for conducting audit is made.\\nKnowledge of subject like economics helps auditor to be familiar with overall economic environment in which specific business is operating. Financial management deals with issues such as funds flow, working capital management, ratio analysis etc. and an auditor is expected to be knowledgeable about these for applying some of audit procedures and carrying out audit effectively.

Absolute assurance is a complete assurance or a guarantee that financial statements are free from material misstatements. However, reasonable assurance is not a complete guarantee. Although it is a high-level of assurance but it is not complete assurance.\\nAudit of financial statements is carried out by the auditor with professional competence and skills in accordance with Standards on Auditing. Audit procedures are applied in accordance with SAs, audit evidence is obtained and evaluated. On basis of that, conclusions are drawn and opinion is formed. It leads to high level of assurance which is called as reasonable assurance but it is not absolute assurance.\\nMisstatements in financial statements can occur due to fraud or error or both. The auditor seeks to obtain reasonable assurance whether financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements caused by fraud or error. He has to see effect of misstatements on financial statements as a whole, in totality.\\nObtaining reasonable assurance that financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements enables the auditor to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\nThe opinion is reported and communicated in accordance with audit findings through a written report as required by Standards on Auditing.

The purpose of an audit is to enhance the degree of confidence of intended users in the financial statements. Users of financial statements may be shareholders, employees, customers, government and regulatory authorities, bankers etc. Enhancing of degree of confidence is achieved by the expression of an opinion by the auditor on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n(Applicable financial reporting framework means a framework adopted in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that is acceptable in view of the nature of the entity and the objective of the financial statements, or that is required by law or regulation.)\\nFor example, in case of companies in India, financial reporting framework is provided under Schedule III of Companies Act,2013.\\n\\nThe following points are included in scope of audit of financial statements: -\\nCoverage of all aspects of entity\\nAudit of financial statements should be organized adequately to cover all aspects of the entity relevant to the financial statements being audited.\\nReliability and sufficiency of financial information\\nThe auditor should be reasonably satisfied that information contained in underlying accounting records and other source data (like bills, vouchers, documents etc.) is reliable and sufficient basis for preparation of financial statements.\\nThe auditor makes a judgment of reliability and sufficiency of financial information by making a study and assessment of accounting systems and internal controls and by carrying out appropriate tests, enquiries and procedures.\\nProper disclosure of financial information\\nThe auditor should also decide whether relevant information is properly disclosed in the financial statements. He should also keep in mind applicable statutory requirements in this regard.\\nIt is done by ensuring that financial statements properly summarize transactions and events recorded therein and by considering the judgments made by management in preparation of financial statements.\\nThe management responsible for preparation and presentation of financial statements makes many judgments in this process of preparing and presenting financial statements. For example, choosing of appropriate accounting policies in relation to various accounting issues like choosing method of charging depreciation on fixed assets or choosing appropriate method for valuation of inventories.\\nThe auditor evaluates selection and consistent application of accounting policies by management; whether such a selection is proper and whether chosen policy has been applied consistently on a period-to-period basis.\\nUnderstand that financial statements of an entity are prepared on historical financial information basis. \"Historical financial information\" means information expressed in financial terms in relation to a particular entity, derived primarily from that entity\\'s accounting system, about economic events occurring in past time periods or about economic conditions or circumstances at points in time in the past.\\nFor example, when purchases and sales are reflected in financial statements of an entity, these are examples of historical financial information. These are about transactions which have occurred in past.\\nSince financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical financial information, it is logical that audit of financial statements is also based upon such historical financial information.

These require different skillsets which may be performed by qualified engineers in their respective fields.\\nAn auditor is not an expert in authentication of documents.

       "  'value': 'INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF AUDIT\\nThe process of audit suffers from certain inbuilt limitations due to which an auditor cannot obtain an absolute assurance that financial statements are free from misstatement due to fraud or error. These fundamental limitations arise due to the following factors: -\\nNature of financial reporting\\nPreparation of financial statements involves making many judgments by management. These judgments may involve subjective decisions or a degree of uncertainty. Therefore, auditor may not be able to obtain absolute assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatements due to frauds or errors.\\nOne of the premises for conducting an audit is that management acknowledges its responsibility of preparation of financial statements in accordance with applicable financial reporting framework and for devising suitable internal controls. However, such controls may not have operated to produce reliable financial information due to their own limitations.\\nConsider, for example, that management of a company has devised a control that all purchase bills should reflect stamp and signatures of an authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" of the company stating the date and time of receiving goods in premises. It is an example of internal control devised by the company to ensure that only those purchase bills are produced for payment for which goods have been actually received. Now, what happens if concerned accountant and authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" collude. It is a case of overriding of internal controls devised by the company due to collusion between two persons. Such a probable collusion is one of limitations of internal controls itself.'},\n",

       "  'value': \"Nature of Audit procedures\\nThe auditor carries out his work by obtaining audit evidence through performance of audit procedures. However, there are practical and legal limitations on ability of auditor to obtain audit evidence. For example, an auditor does not test all transactions and balances. He forms his opinion only by testing samples. It is an example of practical limitation on auditor's ability to obtain audit evidence.\\nManagement may not provide complete information as requested by auditor. There is no way by which auditor can force management to provide complete information as may be requested by auditor. In case he is not provided with required information, he can only report. It is an example of legal limitation on auditor's ability to obtain audit evidence.\\nThe management may consist of dishonest and unscrupulous people and may be, itself, involved in fraud. It may be engaged in concealing fraud by designing sophisticated and carefully organized schemes which may be hard to detect by the auditor. It may produce fabricated documents before auditor to lead him to believe that audit evidence is valid. However, in reality, such documents could be fake or non-genuine.\\nWe have already discussed under section on scope of audit that an auditor is not an expert in authentication of documents. Therefore, he may be led to accept invalid audit evidence on the basis of unauthentic documents.\\nIt is quite possible that entity may have entered into some transactions with related parties. Such transactions may be only paper transactions and may not have actually occurred. The auditor may not be aware of such related party relationships or audit procedures may not be able to detect probable wrong doings in such transactions.\"},\n",

Hence, auditor cannot obtain absolute assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatements due to frauds or errors.\\nTimeliness of financial reporting and decrease in relevance of information over time\\nThe relevance of information decreases over time and auditor cannot verify each and every matter. Therefore, a balance has to be struck between reliability of information and cost of obtaining it.\\nConsider, for example, an auditor who is conducting audit of a company since last two years. During these two years, he has sought detailed information from management of company regarding various matters. During his thirdyear stint, he chooses to rely upon some information obtained as part of audit procedures of second year. However, it could be possible that something new has happened and that information is not relevant.

Adverse events may seriously affect ability of an entity to continue its business. The business may cease to exist in future due to change in market conditions, emergence of new business models or products or due to onset of some adverse events.\\nTherefore, it is in view of above factors, that an auditor cannot provide a guarantee that financial statements are free from material misstatements due to frauds or errors.\\nInherent Limitations of Audit (SA 200 \"Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in Accordance with Standards on Auditing\"): The auditor is not expected to, and cannot, reduce audit risk to zero because there are inherent limitations of an audit. The inherent limitations of an audit arise from:\\nThe Nature of Financial Reporting: The preparation of financial statements involves judgment by management.\\nThe Nature of Audit Procedures: There are practical and legal limitations on the auditor\\'s ability to obtain audit evidence such as:\\nPossibility that management or others may  not provide, intentionally or unintentionally, the complete information relevant for preparation and presentation of FS.\\nFraud may involve sophisticated and carefully organised schemes.\\nNot in the nature of Investigation: An audit is not an official investigation into alleged wrongdoing.\\nTimeliness of financial reporting and decrease in relevance of information\\n over time: Relevance of information, and thereby its value, tends to diminish over time, and there is a balance to be struck between the reliability of information and its cost.\\nFuture events: Future events or conditions may affect an entity adversely. Adverse events may seriously affect ability of an entity to continue its Business.'},\n",

Such engagements are also reasonable assurance engagements. For example, in India, companies are required to get their annual accounts audited by an external auditor.

The financial statements are prepared by management consisting of directors. As shareholders are owners of the company, they need an independent mechanism so that financial information is qualitative and reliable. Hence, their interest is safeguarded by an audit.\\nAn audit acts as a moral check on employees from committing frauds for the fear of being discovered by audit.\\nAudited financial statements are helpful to government authorities for determining tax liabilities.\\nAudited financial statements can be relied upon by lenders, bankers for making their credit decisions i.e. whether to lend or not to lend to a particular entity.\\nAn audit may also detect fraud or error or both.\\nAn audit reviews existence and operations of various controls operating in any entity.

A practitioner is a person who provides the assurance. The term practitioner is broader than auditor. Audit is related to historical information whereas practitioner may provide assurance not necessarily related to historical financial information.\\nA responsible party is the party responsible for preparation of subject matter.\\nIntended users are the persons for whom an assurance report is prepared. These persons may use the report in making decisions.\\nAn appropriate subject matter\\nIt refers to the information to be examined by the practitioner. For example, financial information contained in financial statements while conducting audit of financial statements.\\nSuitable criteria\\nThese refer to benchmarks used to evaluate the subject matter like standards, guidance, laws, rules and regulations.\\nSufficient appropriate evidence\\nThe practitioner performs an assurance engagement to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence. It is on the basis of evidence that conclusions are arrived and an opinion is formed by auditor.\\n\"Sufficient\" relates to quantity of evidence obtained by auditor. \"Appropriate\" relates to quality of evidence obtained by auditor. One evidence may be providing more comfort to auditor than the other evidence. The evidence providing more comfort is qualitative and, therefore, appropriate. Evidence should be both sufficient and appropriate.\\nA written assurance report in appropriate form\\nA written report is provided containing conclusion that conveys the assurance about the subject matter.

The difference is of degree. Reasonable assurance engagement like audit provides reasonable assurance which is a high level of assurance. Limited assurance engagement like review provides lower level of assurance than audit. It is only a moderate level of assurance.\\n- Reasonable assurance engagement is a process that provides a high level of assurance through the performance of extensive procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence.\\n- In contrast, limited assurance engagement offers a lower level of assurance, performing fewer procedures than a reasonable assurance engagement.\\n- A reasonable assurance engagement results in conclusions based on the adequacy of the evidence gathered during the process.\\n- An example of reasonable assurance engagement is an audit, which involves a thorough examination and provides a high level of assurance.\\n- Conversely, an example of limited assurance engagement is a review, which provides a moderate level of assurance and involves less detailed procedures.\\nBesides reasonable assurance engagements and limited assurance engagements, there is another kind of assurance which is related to matters other than historical financial information. Such an assurance may relate to prospective financial information and not to historical financial information. It may relate to providing assurance on internal controls in an entity.\\n\"Prospective financial information\" means financial information based on assumptions about events that may occur in the future and possible actions by an entity. It can be in the form of a forecast or projection or combination of both.\\nIt is to be noted that in such type of assurance engagements, examination is not of historical financial information.\\nHere, it is important to note the difference between \"Historical financial information\" and \"Prospective financial information.\" The former relates to information expressed in financial terms of an entity about economic events, conditions or circumstances occurring in past periods. The latter relates to financial information based on assumptions about occurrence of future events and possible actions by an entity.\\nTherefore, historical financial information is rooted in past events which have already occurred whereas prospective financial information is related to future events.\\nIn assurance reports involving prospective financial information, the practitioner obtains sufficient appropriate evidence to the effect that management\\'s assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based are not unreasonable, the prospective financial information is properly prepared on the basis of the assumptions and it is properly presented and all material assumptions are adequately disclosed.\\nProspective financial information relates to future events. While evidence may be available to support the assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based, such evidence is itself generally future- oriented. The auditor is, therefore, not in a position to express an opinion as to whether the results shown in the prospective financial information will be achieved.\\nTherefore, in such assurance engagements, practitioner provides a report assuring that nothing has come to practitioner\\'s attention to suggest that these assumptions do not provide a reasonable basis for the projection.\\nHence, such type of assurance engagement provides only a \"moderate\" level of assurance.\\nExamples of assurance engagements\\n- An audit of financial statements is classified as a reasonable assurance engagement, aiming to provide a high assurance level that financial statements are free from material misstatement.\\n- A review of financial statements is considered a limited assurance engagement, which offers a moderate assurance level that no material modifications need to be made to the financial statements.\\n- The examination of prospective financial information is an assurance engagement that assesses the reasonableness of assumptions used in projections and related matters.\\n- Reporting on controls operating at an organization is an assurance engagement that evaluates the design and operation of an organization’s controls.\\nThe various categories of assurance engagements, which are professional services typically provided by certified accountants. The three main branches, originating from the overarching category of \"Assurance Engagements.\" Each branch is detailed below:\\n\\nReasonable Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis branch represents a high level of assurance provided by the auditor or accountant. It bifurcates into one sub-category:\\n\\nAudit: This is a type of reasonable assurance engagement where the auditor expresses an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n\\nLimited Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis type of engagement provides a moderate level of assurance, less than that of a reasonable assurance engagement, but more than the level of assurance that would be provided by a compilation. It has one sub-category:\\n\\nReview: A review engagement is where the accountant performs procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and performing analytical procedures, to express a conclusion that provides a limited level of assurance on the financial statements.\\n\\nAssurance Engagements dealing with matters other than historical financial information:\\n\\nThis branch indicates assurance services that do not focus on historical financial data. It includes:\\n\\nExamination of prospective financial information (like forecast): This involves engagements where auditors evaluate the preparation and presentation of financial forecasts and projections.\\n\\nAssurance regarding operations of controls: Here, the assurance practitioner provides an opinion on the design, implementation, and/or effectiveness of the controls at a service organization.\\n\\nEach of these branches indicates a different scope of work, level of assurance, and purpose within the realm of assurance engagements, offering various options depending on the needs of the users of the financial information.'},\n",

Besides ensuring compliance with professional standards, it helps in performing audit engagement effectively.\\nAdequate planning benefits the audit of financial statements in several ways, including the following: -\\nHelping the auditor to devote appropriate attention to important areas of the audit.\\nHelping the auditor identify and resolve potential problems on a timely basis.\\nHelping the auditor properly organize and manage the audit engagement so that it is performed in an effective and efficient manner.\\nAssisting in the selection of engagement team members with appropriate levels of capabilities and competence to respond to anticipated risks, and the proper assignment of work to them.\\nFacilitating the direction and supervision of engagement team members and the review of their work.\\nAssisting, where applicable, in coordination of work done by others such as experts\\nTherefore, planning an audit ensures that audit risk is reduced to an acceptable low level. When audit work is adequately and properly planned, it reduces the risk of inappropriate opinion by the auditor.\\nThe key components of the benefits of planning within the context of an audit. The central hexagon states \"Benefits of Planning,\" which is the core theme of the diagram, indicating that the elements surrounding this central hexagon are outcomes or advantages derived from effective planning in audit engagements. Each of the surrounding hexagons connects to the central idea, illustrating the multifaceted nature of these benefits. The elements detailed are as follows:\\n\\nAppropriate attention to important areas: This implies that planning allows for the identification and prioritization of significant areas within the audit process, ensuring that adequate resources and attention are devoted to them.\\n\\nIdentify and Resolve Potential Problems: Effective planning facilitates the early identification of potential issues, which can then be addressed in a timely manner to prevent adverse effects on the audit process.\\n\\nEfficient and Effective Audit: Proper planning is crucial for conducting an audit that is both efficient, in terms of resource utilization, and effective in achieving the audit objectives.\\n\\nSelection of Team Members: Planning enables the careful selection of audit team members whose skills and competencies align with the specific requirements of the audit engagement.\\n\\nDirection and Supervision of Team & Review of work: It encompasses the guidance provided to the team members, ensuring that their efforts are aligned with the audit objectives, as well as the subsequent review of their work to maintain quality and compliance with auditing standards.\\n\\nCoordination with other Auditors and Experts: Planning ensures that there is effective coordination with any other auditors and experts whose input is necessary for areas requiring specialized knowledge.\\n\\nEach of these aspects underscores the importance of meticulous planning in the audit process, leading to a more structured and focused audit approach that enhances the overall quality and reliability of the audit outcome.'},\n",

For example, planning includes the need to consider, prior to the auditor's identification and assessment of the risks of material misstatement, such matters as: -\\nThe analytical procedures to be applied as risk assessment procedures.\\nObtaining a general understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the entity and how the entity is complying with that framework.\\nThe determination of materiality.\\nThe involvement of experts.\\nThe performance of other risk assessment procedures.\\nRisk assessment procedures are audit procedures performed to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity's internal control, to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error at the financial statement and assertion levels.\\nTherefore, planning includes consideration of matters such as obtaining knowledge about legal framework in which entity is operating. Consider for example- Telecom companies and Banks. Such entities operate in different legal and regulatory frameworks. TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) and RBI (Reserve Bank of India) are regulators for telecom and banking industry respectively.\\nPlanning also includes need to consider determination of material or significant matters. It also involves considering whether experts need to be involved taking into account complexity of business. Further, it also involves considering need to perform risk assessment procedures for identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement.\\nPlanning is not a separate or distinct phase of an audit. It is to be viewed as a continual and repetitive process.

Examples are listed as under: -\\nResults of previous audits that involved evaluating the operating effectiveness of internal control, including the nature of identified deficiencies and action taken to address them.\\nThe manner in which the auditor emphasizes to engagement team members the need to maintain a questioning mind and to exercise professional skepticism in gathering and evaluating audit evidence.\\n\\nAscertain the nature, timing and extent of resources necessary to perform the engagement.\\nSelection of engagement team and assignment of audit work to team members is a significant factor in establishing overall audit strategy.
