Auditing has existed even in ancient times in many societies of world including India. The reference to auditing is found in Kautilya\\'s Arthshastra even in  century BC. It talks about fixed accounting year, a process for closure of accounts and audit for the same. Concepts of periodical checking and verification existed even in those times. Even there are references in his monumental work to misstatements in financial statements due to abuse of power. Wasn\\'t he far ahead of his times?\\nThe word \"audit\" originates from Latin word \"audire\" meaning \"to hear\". In medieval times, auditors used to hear the accounts read out to them to check that employees were not careless and negligent. Industrial revolution in Europe led to astronomical expansion in volume of trade and consequently demand of auditors.\\nComing to more recent history, the first Auditor General of India was appointed in British India in 1860 having both accounting and auditing functions. Later on, office of Auditor General was given statutory recognition. Presently, Comptroller and Auditor General of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing government receipts and expenditures.\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established as a statutory body under an Act of Parliament in 1949 for regulating the profession of Chartered Accountancy in the country.'}\n",

The \\tauditor should be independent of entity whose financial statements are subject to \\taudit so that he can form an opinion without being affected by any influence. \\tIndependence increases auditor\\'s ability to act objectively without creeping in of \\tany biases.\\nConsider, for example, a person who requests his brother, a Chartered Accountant,to audit accounts of his proprietary concern and issue a report. Can CA audit accounts of concern in which his brother is sole proprietor? No, he cannot. It is due to the fact that there would be no independence in such a case due to relationship by birth between CA and his brother. He would be subject to influence from his brother.\\nTake another case where a CA has invested in shares of a company. Can he audit \\taccounts of such a company in which he holds shares? The answer is resounding \\tNO. It is due to the fact that by holding shares of the company, his own self-\\tinterest gets involved. His own money is invested in the company and he may not \\tbe able to form judgment independently on the financial statements of the \\tcompany.\\nThe entity whose financial information is examined need not necessarily be profit oriented like in case of a business. It can be a non-profit organization like an NGO or a charitable trust. Audit can be undertaken in respect of any organization be it a small, medium or large. Further, it can be conducted for any entity irrespective of its legal structure i.e. such an entity may be a proprietary concern, a partnership firm, a LLP, a private company, a public company, a society or a trust.\\nThe purpose of audit is to express an opinion on the financial statements.\\nUnderstand that preparation and presentation of financial statements of an entity is responsibility of management of entity. The auditor expresses an opinion on financial statements by means of written audit report.\\nIn doing so, he has to see that financial statements would not mislead anybody by ensuring that: -\\nthe accounts have been drawn up with reference to entries in the books of account;\\nthe entries in the books of account are adequately supported by sufficient and appropriate evidence;\\nnone of the entries in the books of account has been omitted in the process of compilation;\\nthe information conveyed by the statements is clear and unambiguous;\\nthe financial statement amounts are properly classified, described and disclosed in conformity with accounting standards; and\\nthe statement of accounts presents a true and fair picture of the operational results and of the assets and liabilities.\\nAuditing provides assurance. Its basic nature lies in providing assurance to users providing confidence to users of financial statements. Such an assurance lends credibility to financial statements. Audited financial statements provide confidence to users that financial information reflected in financial statements can be relied upon.'}\n",

It draws from diverse subjects including accountancy, law, behavioural science, statistics, economics and financial management and makes use of these subjects. Since audit of financial statements is concerned with financial information, a sound knowledge of accounting principles is a fundamental requirement for an auditor of financial statements to conduct audit and express an opinion. Similarly, good knowledge of business laws and various taxation laws helps auditor to understand financial statements in a better way in accordance with applicable laws.\\nDuring course of audit, auditor has to interact with lot of persons for seeking information and making inquiries. This can be done only if one has knowledge of human behaviour. Auditors use statistical methods to draw samples in a scientific manner. It is not possible for an auditor to check each and every transaction. So, use of statistical methods to draw samples for conducting audit is made.\\nKnowledge of subject like economics helps auditor to be familiar with overall economic environment in which specific business is operating. Financial management deals with issues such as funds flow, working capital management, ratio analysis etc. and an auditor is expected to be knowledgeable about these for applying some of audit procedures and carrying out audit effectively. Besides, knowledge of financial markets comprised in study of financial management is expected from a professional auditor.\\nAuditing and Accounting: Auditing reviews the financial statements which are nothing but a result of the overall accounting process.\\nAuditing and Law: An auditor should have a good knowledge of business laws affecting the entity.\\nAuditing and Economics: Auditor is expected to be familiar with the overall economic environment of the client.\\nAuditing and Behavioural Science: Knowledge of human behaviour is essential for an auditor to effectively discharge his duties.\\nAuditing and Statistics & Mathematics: Auditor is also expected to have the knowledge of statistical sampling for meaningful conclusions and mathematics for verification of inventories.\\nAuditing and Data Processing: EDP auditing in itself is developing as a discipline in itself.\\nAuditing and Financial Management : Auditor is expected to have knowledge about various financial techniques such as working capital management, funds flow, ratio analysis, capital budgeting etc.\\nAuditing and Production: Good auditor is one who understands the client and his business functions such as production, cost system, marketing etc.'}\n",

Absolute assurance is a complete assurance or a guarantee that financial statements are free from material misstatements. However, reasonable assurance is not a complete guarantee. Although it is a high-level of assurance but it is not complete assurance.\\nAudit of financial statements is carried out by the auditor with professional competence and skills in accordance with Standards on Auditing. Audit procedures are applied in accordance with SAs, audit evidence is obtained and evaluated. On basis of that, conclusions are drawn and opinion is formed. It leads to high level of assurance which is called as reasonable assurance but it is not absolute assurance.\\nMisstatements in financial statements can occur due to fraud or error or both. The auditor seeks to obtain reasonable assurance whether financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements caused by fraud or error. He has to see effect of misstatements on financial statements as a whole, in totality.\\nObtaining reasonable assurance that financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements enables the auditor to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\nThe opinion is reported and communicated in accordance with audit findings through a written report as required by Standards on Auditing.

The purpose of an audit is to enhance the degree of confidence of intended users in the financial statements.

He should also keep in mind applicable statutory requirements in this regard.\\nIt is done by ensuring that financial statements properly summarize transactions and events recorded therein and by considering the judgments made by management in preparation of financial statements.\\nThe management responsible for preparation and presentation of financial statements makes many judgments in this process of preparing and presenting financial statements. For example, choosing of appropriate accounting policies in relation to various accounting issues like choosing method of charging depreciation on fixed assets or choosing appropriate method for valuation of inventories.\\nThe auditor evaluates selection and consistent application of accounting policies by management; whether such a selection is proper and whether chosen policy has been applied consistently on a period-to-period basis.\\nUnderstand that financial statements of an entity are prepared on historical financial information basis. \"Historical financial information\" means information expressed in financial terms in relation to a particular entity, derived primarily from that entity\\'s accounting system, about economic events occurring in past time periods or about economic conditions or circumstances at points in time in the past.\\nFor example, when purchases and sales are reflected in financial statements of an entity, these are examples of historical financial information. These are about transactions which have occurred in past.\\nSince financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical financial information, it is logical that audit of financial statements is also based upon such historical financial information.

These judgments may involve subjective decisions or a degree of uncertainty. Therefore, auditor may not be able to obtain absolute assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatements due to frauds or errors.\\nOne of the premises for conducting an audit is that management acknowledges its responsibility of preparation of financial statements in accordance with applicable financial reporting framework and for devising suitable internal controls. However, such controls may not have operated to produce reliable financial information due to their own limitations.\\nConsider, for example, that management of a company has devised a control that all purchase bills should reflect stamp and signatures of an authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" of the company stating the date and time of receiving goods in premises. It is an example of internal control devised by the company to ensure that only those purchase bills are produced for payment for which goods have been actually received.

Evidence should be both sufficient and appropriate.\\nA written assurance report in appropriate form\\nA written report is provided containing conclusion that conveys the assurance about the subject matter. A written assurance report is the outcome of an assurance engagement.\\nOverview of Elements of assurance engagement\\n- An assurance engagement involves a three-party relationship consisting of the responsible party, the practitioner, and the intended users.\\n- The subject matter of an assurance engagement must be appropriate, meaning it is capable of evaluation against suitable criteria and available for the practitioner to obtain evidence.\\n- Suitable criteria are standards or benchmarks applied to the subject matter of the assurance engagement against which the practitioner evaluates the information.\\n- Sufficient appropriate evidence is necessary to support the practitioner\\'s conclusion and is obtained through the assurance engagement process.\\n- A written assurance report is provided in an appropriate form to communicate the conclusion of the assurance engagement to its intended users.'}\n",

The difference is of degree. Reasonable assurance engagement like audit provides reasonable assurance which is a high level of assurance. Limited assurance engagement like review provides lower level of assurance than audit. It is only a moderate level of assurance.\\n- Reasonable assurance engagement is a process that provides a high level of assurance through the performance of extensive procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence.\\n- In contrast, limited assurance engagement offers a lower level of assurance, performing fewer procedures than a reasonable assurance engagement.\\n- A reasonable assurance engagement results in conclusions based on the adequacy of the evidence gathered during the process.\\n- An example of reasonable assurance engagement is an audit, which involves a thorough examination and provides a high level of assurance.\\n- Conversely, an example of limited assurance engagement is a review, which provides a moderate level of assurance and involves less detailed procedures.\\nBesides reasonable assurance engagements and limited assurance engagements, there is another kind of assurance which is related to matters other than historical financial information. Such an assurance may relate to prospective financial information and not to historical financial information. It may relate to providing assurance on internal controls in an entity.\\n\"Prospective financial information\" means financial information based on assumptions about events that may occur in the future and possible actions by an entity. It can be in the form of a forecast or projection or combination of both.\\nIt is to be noted that in such type of assurance engagements, examination is not of historical financial information.\\nHere, it is important to note the difference between \"Historical financial information\" and \"Prospective financial information.\" The former relates to information expressed in financial terms of an entity about economic events, conditions or circumstances occurring in past periods. The latter relates to financial information based on assumptions about occurrence of future events and possible actions by an entity.\\nTherefore, historical financial information is rooted in past events which have already occurred whereas prospective financial information is related to future events.\\nIn assurance reports involving prospective financial information, the practitioner obtains sufficient appropriate evidence to the effect that management\\'s assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based are not unreasonable, the prospective financial information is properly prepared on the basis of the assumptions and it is properly presented and all material assumptions are adequately disclosed.\\nProspective financial information relates to future events. While evidence may be available to support the assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based, such evidence is itself generally future- oriented. The auditor is, therefore, not in a position to express an opinion as to whether the results shown in the prospective financial information will be achieved.\\nTherefore, in such assurance engagements, practitioner provides a report assuring that nothing has come to practitioner\\'s attention to suggest that these assumptions do not provide a reasonable basis for the projection.\\nHence, such type of assurance engagement provides only a \"moderate\" level of assurance.\\nExamples of assurance engagements\\n- An audit of financial statements is classified as a reasonable assurance engagement, aiming to provide a high assurance level that financial statements are free from material misstatement.\\n- A review of financial statements is considered a limited assurance engagement, which offers a moderate assurance level that no material modifications need to be made to the financial statements.\\n- The examination of prospective financial information is an assurance engagement that assesses the reasonableness of assumptions used in projections and related matters.\\n- Reporting on controls operating at an organization is an assurance engagement that evaluates the design and operation of an organization’s controls.\\nThe various categories of assurance engagements, which are professional services typically provided by certified accountants. The three main branches, originating from the overarching category of \"Assurance Engagements.\" Each branch is detailed below:\\n\\nReasonable Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis branch represents a high level of assurance provided by the auditor or accountant. It bifurcates into one sub-category:\\n\\nAudit: This is a type of reasonable assurance engagement where the auditor expresses an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n\\nLimited Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis type of engagement provides a moderate level of assurance, less than that of a reasonable assurance engagement, but more than the level of assurance that would be provided by a compilation. It has one sub-category:\\n\\nReview: A review engagement is where the accountant performs procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and performing analytical procedures, to express a conclusion that provides a limited level of assurance on the financial statements.\\n\\nAssurance Engagements dealing with matters other than historical financial information:\\n\\nThis branch indicates assurance services that do not focus on historical financial data. It includes:\\n\\nExamination of prospective financial information (like forecast): This involves engagements where auditors evaluate the preparation and presentation of financial forecasts and projections.\\n\\nAssurance regarding operations of controls: Here, the assurance practitioner provides an opinion on the design, implementation, and/or effectiveness of the controls at a service organization.\\n\\nEach of these branches indicates a different scope of work, level of assurance, and purpose within the realm of assurance engagements, offering various options depending on the needs of the users of the financial information.'}\n",

Auditing has existed even in ancient times in many societies of world including India. The reference to auditing is found in Kautilya\\'s Arthshastra even in  century BC. It talks about fixed accounting year, a process for closure of accounts and audit for the same. Concepts of periodical checking and verification existed even in those times. Even there are references in his monumental work to misstatements in financial statements due to abuse of power. Wasn\\'t he far ahead of his times?\\nThe word \"audit\" originates from Latin word \"audire\" meaning \"to hear\". In medieval times, auditors used to hear the accounts read out to them to check that employees were not careless and negligent. Industrial revolution in Europe led to astronomical expansion in volume of trade and consequently demand of auditors.\\nComing to more recent history, the first Auditor General of India was appointed in British India in 1860 having both accounting and auditing functions. Later on, office of Auditor General was given statutory recognition. Presently, Comptroller and Auditor General of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing government receipts and expenditures.\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established as a statutory body under an Act of Parliament in 1949 for regulating the profession of Chartered Accountancy in the country.'}\n",

The \\tauditor should be independent of entity whose financial statements are subject to \\taudit so that he can form an opinion without being affected by any influence. \\tIndependence increases auditor\\'s ability to act objectively without creeping in of \\tany biases.\\nConsider, for example, a person who requests his brother, a Chartered Accountant,to audit accounts of his proprietary concern and issue a report. Can CA audit accounts of concern in which his brother is sole proprietor? No, he cannot. It is due to the fact that there would be no independence in such a case due to relationship by birth between CA and his brother. He would be subject to influence from his brother.\\nTake another case where a CA has invested in shares of a company. Can he audit \\taccounts of such a company in which he holds shares? The answer is resounding \\tNO. It is due to the fact that by holding shares of the company, his own self-\\tinterest gets involved. His own money is invested in the company and he may not \\tbe able to form judgment independently on the financial statements of the \\tcompany.\\nThe entity whose financial information is examined need not necessarily be profit oriented like in case of a business. It can be a non-profit organization like an NGO or a charitable trust. Audit can be undertaken in respect of any organization be it a small, medium or large. Further, it can be conducted for any entity irrespective of its legal structure i.e. such an entity may be a proprietary concern, a partnership firm, a LLP, a private company, a public company, a society or a trust.\\nThe purpose of audit is to express an opinion on the financial statements.\\nUnderstand that preparation and presentation of financial statements of an entity is responsibility of management of entity. The auditor expresses an opinion on financial statements by means of written audit report.\\nIn doing so, he has to see that financial statements would not mislead anybody by ensuring that: -\\nthe accounts have been drawn up with reference to entries in the books of account;\\nthe entries in the books of account are adequately supported by sufficient and appropriate evidence;\\nnone of the entries in the books of account has been omitted in the process of compilation;\\nthe information conveyed by the statements is clear and unambiguous;\\nthe financial statement amounts are properly classified, described and disclosed in conformity with accounting standards; and\\nthe statement of accounts presents a true and fair picture of the operational results and of the assets and liabilities.\\nAuditing provides assurance.

For example, if fraud is suspected and it is specifically called upon to check the accounts whether fraud really exists, it takes character of investigation.\\nThe objective of audit, on the other hand, as has already been discussed, is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, thereby enabling the auditor to express an opinion.\\nThe scope of audit is general and broad whereas scope of investigation is specific and narrow.\\nAn Overview of Scope of Audit\\n- The scope of an audit of financial statements includes the comprehensive examination of all aspects of the entity that are relevant to the financial statements being audited.\\n- It encompasses assessing the reliability and sufficiency of the financial information presented in the statements.\\n- Ensuring proper disclosure of all pertinent financial information in the statements is a key part of the audit scope.\\n- The auditor is responsible for expressing an opinion on the financial statements based on the audit evidence obtained.\\n- The preparation and presentation of financial statements fall outside the auditor's responsibilities; this is the management's duty.\\n- Actions beyond the auditor's professional competence are not within the scope of the audit.\\n- The auditor is not required to possess expertise in the authentication of documents; such expertise lies beyond the typical scope of auditing.\\n- Conducting investigations is not typically within the scope of a standard financial statement audit.\"}\n",

These fundamental limitations arise due to the following factors: -\\nNature of financial reporting\\nPreparation of financial statements involves making many judgments by management. These judgments may involve subjective decisions or a degree of uncertainty. Therefore, auditor may not be able to obtain absolute assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatements due to frauds or errors.\\nOne of the premises for conducting an audit is that management acknowledges its responsibility of preparation of financial statements in accordance with applicable financial reporting framework and for devising suitable internal controls. However, such controls may not have operated to produce reliable financial information due to their own limitations.\\nConsider, for example, that management of a company has devised a control that all purchase bills should reflect stamp and signatures of an authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" of the company stating the date and time of receiving goods in premises. It is an example of internal control devised by the company to ensure that only those purchase bills are produced for payment for which goods have been actually received. Now, what happens if concerned accountant and authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" collude. It is a case of overriding of internal controls devised by the company due to collusion between two persons. Such a probable collusion is one of limitations of internal controls itself.'}\n",

However, there are practical and legal limitations on ability of auditor to obtain audit evidence. For example, an auditor does not test all transactions and balances. He forms his opinion only by testing samples. It is an example of practical limitation on auditor's ability to obtain audit evidence.\\nManagement may not provide complete information as requested by auditor. There is no way by which auditor can force management to provide complete information as may be requested by auditor. In case he is not provided with required information, he can only report. It is an example of legal limitation on auditor's ability to obtain audit evidence.\\nThe management may consist of dishonest and unscrupulous people and may be, itself, involved in fraud. It may be engaged in concealing fraud by designing sophisticated and carefully organized schemes which may be hard to detect by the auditor. It may produce fabricated documents before auditor to lead him to believe that audit evidence is valid. However, in reality, such documents could be fake or non-genuine.\\nWe have already discussed under section on scope of audit that an auditor is not an expert in authentication of documents. Therefore, he may be led to accept invalid audit evidence on the basis of unauthentic documents.\\nIt is quite possible that entity may have entered into some transactions with related parties. Such transactions may be only paper transactions and may not have actually occurred.

A practitioner is a person who provides the assurance. The term practitioner is broader than auditor. Audit is related to historical information whereas practitioner may provide assurance not necessarily related to historical financial information.\\nA responsible party is the party responsible for preparation of subject matter.\\nIntended users are the persons for whom an assurance report is prepared. These persons may use the report in making decisions.\\nAn appropriate subject matter\\nIt refers to the information to be examined by the practitioner. For example, financial information contained in financial statements while conducting audit of financial statements.\\nSuitable criteria\\nThese refer to benchmarks used to evaluate the subject matter like standards, guidance, laws, rules and regulations.\\nSufficient appropriate evidence\\nThe practitioner performs an assurance engagement to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence. It is on the basis of evidence that conclusions are arrived and an opinion is formed by auditor.\\n\"Sufficient\" relates to quantity of evidence obtained by auditor. \"Appropriate\" relates to quality of evidence obtained by auditor. One evidence may be providing more comfort to auditor than the other evidence. The evidence providing more comfort is qualitative and, therefore, appropriate.

The difference is of degree. Reasonable assurance engagement like audit provides reasonable assurance which is a high level of assurance. Limited assurance engagement like review provides lower level of assurance than audit. It is only a moderate level of assurance.\\n- Reasonable assurance engagement is a process that provides a high level of assurance through the performance of extensive procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence.\\n- In contrast, limited assurance engagement offers a lower level of assurance, performing fewer procedures than a reasonable assurance engagement.\\n- A reasonable assurance engagement results in conclusions based on the adequacy of the evidence gathered during the process.\\n- An example of reasonable assurance engagement is an audit, which involves a thorough examination and provides a high level of assurance.\\n- Conversely, an example of limited assurance engagement is a review, which provides a moderate level of assurance and involves less detailed procedures.\\nBesides reasonable assurance engagements and limited assurance engagements, there is another kind of assurance which is related to matters other than historical financial information. Such an assurance may relate to prospective financial information and not to historical financial information. It may relate to providing assurance on internal controls in an entity.\\n\"Prospective financial information\" means financial information based on assumptions about events that may occur in the future and possible actions by an entity. It can be in the form of a forecast or projection or combination of both.\\nIt is to be noted that in such type of assurance engagements, examination is not of historical financial information.\\nHere, it is important to note the difference between \"Historical financial information\" and \"Prospective financial information.\" The former relates to information expressed in financial terms of an entity about economic events, conditions or circumstances occurring in past periods. The latter relates to financial information based on assumptions about occurrence of future events and possible actions by an entity.\\nTherefore, historical financial information is rooted in past events which have already occurred whereas prospective financial information is related to future events.\\nIn assurance reports involving prospective financial information, the practitioner obtains sufficient appropriate evidence to the effect that management\\'s assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based are not unreasonable, the prospective financial information is properly prepared on the basis of the assumptions and it is properly presented and all material assumptions are adequately disclosed.\\nProspective financial information relates to future events. While evidence may be available to support the assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based, such evidence is itself generally future- oriented. The auditor is, therefore, not in a position to express an opinion as to whether the results shown in the prospective financial information will be achieved.\\nTherefore, in such assurance engagements, practitioner provides a report assuring that nothing has come to practitioner\\'s attention to suggest that these assumptions do not provide a reasonable basis for the projection.\\nHence, such type of assurance engagement provides only a \"moderate\" level of assurance.\\nExamples of assurance engagements\\n- An audit of financial statements is classified as a reasonable assurance engagement, aiming to provide a high assurance level that financial statements are free from material misstatement.\\n- A review of financial statements is considered a limited assurance engagement, which offers a moderate assurance level that no material modifications need to be made to the financial statements.\\n- The examination of prospective financial information is an assurance engagement that assesses the reasonableness of assumptions used in projections and related matters.\\n- Reporting on controls operating at an organization is an assurance engagement that evaluates the design and operation of an organization’s controls.\\nThe various categories of assurance engagements, which are professional services typically provided by certified accountants. The three main branches, originating from the overarching category of \"Assurance Engagements.\" Each branch is detailed below:\\n\\nReasonable Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis branch represents a high level of assurance provided by the auditor or accountant. It bifurcates into one sub-category:\\n\\nAudit: This is a type of reasonable assurance engagement where the auditor expresses an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n\\nLimited Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis type of engagement provides a moderate level of assurance, less than that of a reasonable assurance engagement, but more than the level of assurance that would be provided by a compilation. It has one sub-category:\\n\\nReview: A review engagement is where the accountant performs procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and performing analytical procedures, to express a conclusion that provides a limited level of assurance on the financial statements.\\n\\nAssurance Engagements dealing with matters other than historical financial information:\\n\\nThis branch indicates assurance services that do not focus on historical financial data. It includes:\\n\\nExamination of prospective financial information (like forecast): This involves engagements where auditors evaluate the preparation and presentation of financial forecasts and projections.\\n\\nAssurance regarding operations of controls: Here, the assurance practitioner provides an opinion on the design, implementation, and/or effectiveness of the controls at a service organization.\\n\\nEach of these branches indicates a different scope of work, level of assurance, and purpose within the realm of assurance engagements, offering various options depending on the needs of the users of the financial information.'}\n",

Auditing has existed even in ancient times in many societies of world including India. The reference to auditing is found in Kautilya\\'s Arthshastra even in  century BC. It talks about fixed accounting year, a process for closure of accounts and audit for the same. Concepts of periodical checking and verification existed even in those times. Even there are references in his monumental work to misstatements in financial statements due to abuse of power. Wasn\\'t he far ahead of his times?\\nThe word \"audit\" originates from Latin word \"audire\" meaning \"to hear\". In medieval times, auditors used to hear the accounts read out to them to check that employees were not careless and negligent. Industrial revolution in Europe led to astronomical expansion in volume of trade and consequently demand of auditors.\\nComing to more recent history, the first Auditor General of India was appointed in British India in 1860 having both accounting and auditing functions. Later on, office of Auditor General was given statutory recognition. Presently, Comptroller and Auditor General of India is an independent constitutional authority responsible for auditing government receipts and expenditures.\\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established as a statutory body under an Act of Parliament in 1949 for regulating the profession of Chartered Accountancy in the country.'}\n",

The \\tauditor should be independent of entity whose financial statements are subject to \\taudit so that he can form an opinion without being affected by any influence. \\tIndependence increases auditor\\'s ability to act objectively without creeping in of \\tany biases.\\nConsider, for example, a person who requests his brother, a Chartered Accountant,to audit accounts of his proprietary concern and issue a report. Can CA audit accounts of concern in which his brother is sole proprietor? No, he cannot. It is due to the fact that there would be no independence in such a case due to relationship by birth between CA and his brother. He would be subject to influence from his brother.\\nTake another case where a CA has invested in shares of a company. Can he audit \\taccounts of such a company in which he holds shares? The answer is resounding \\tNO. It is due to the fact that by holding shares of the company, his own self-\\tinterest gets involved. His own money is invested in the company and he may not \\tbe able to form judgment independently on the financial statements of the \\tcompany.\\nThe entity whose financial information is examined need not necessarily be profit oriented like in case of a business. It can be a non-profit organization like an NGO or a charitable trust. Audit can be undertaken in respect of any organization be it a small, medium or large. Further, it can be conducted for any entity irrespective of its legal structure i.e. such an entity may be a proprietary concern, a partnership firm, a LLP, a private company, a public company, a society or a trust.\\nThe purpose of audit is to express an opinion on the financial statements.\\nUnderstand that preparation and presentation of financial statements of an entity is responsibility of management of entity. The auditor expresses an opinion on financial statements by means of written audit report.\\nIn doing so, he has to see that financial statements would not mislead anybody by ensuring that: -\\nthe accounts have been drawn up with reference to entries in the books of account;\\nthe entries in the books of account are adequately supported by sufficient and appropriate evidence;\\nnone of the entries in the books of account has been omitted in the process of compilation;\\nthe information conveyed by the statements is clear and unambiguous;\\nthe financial statement amounts are properly classified, described and disclosed in conformity with accounting standards; and\\nthe statement of accounts presents a true and fair picture of the operational results and of the assets and liabilities.\\nAuditing provides assurance. Its basic nature lies in providing assurance to users providing confidence to users of financial statements. Such an assurance lends credibility to financial statements. Audited financial statements provide confidence to users that financial information reflected in financial statements can be relied upon.'}\n",

It draws from diverse subjects including accountancy, law, behavioural science, statistics, economics and financial management and makes use of these subjects. Since audit of financial statements is concerned with financial information, a sound knowledge of accounting principles is a fundamental requirement for an auditor of financial statements to conduct audit and express an opinion. Similarly, good knowledge of business laws and various taxation laws helps auditor to understand financial statements in a better way in accordance with applicable laws.\\nDuring course of audit, auditor has to interact with lot of persons for seeking information and making inquiries. This can be done only if one has knowledge of human behaviour. Auditors use statistical methods to draw samples in a scientific manner. It is not possible for an auditor to check each and every transaction. So, use of statistical methods to draw samples for conducting audit is made.\\nKnowledge of subject like economics helps auditor to be familiar with overall economic environment in which specific business is operating. Financial management deals with issues such as funds flow, working capital management, ratio analysis etc. and an auditor is expected to be knowledgeable about these for applying some of audit procedures and carrying out audit effectively. Besides, knowledge of financial markets comprised in study of financial management is expected from a professional auditor.\\nAuditing and Accounting: Auditing reviews the financial statements which are nothing but a result of the overall accounting process.\\nAuditing and Law: An auditor should have a good knowledge of business laws affecting the entity.\\nAuditing and Economics: Auditor is expected to be familiar with the overall economic environment of the client.\\nAuditing and Behavioural Science: Knowledge of human behaviour is essential for an auditor to effectively discharge his duties.\\nAuditing and Statistics & Mathematics: Auditor is also expected to have the knowledge of statistical sampling for meaningful conclusions and mathematics for verification of inventories.\\nAuditing and Data Processing: EDP auditing in itself is developing as a discipline in itself.\\nAuditing and Financial Management : Auditor is expected to have knowledge about various financial techniques such as working capital management, funds flow, ratio analysis, capital budgeting etc.\\nAuditing and Production: Good auditor is one who understands the client and his business functions such as production, cost system, marketing etc.'}\n",

Absolute assurance is a complete assurance or a guarantee that financial statements are free from material misstatements. However, reasonable assurance is not a complete guarantee. Although it is a high-level of assurance but it is not complete assurance.\\nAudit of financial statements is carried out by the auditor with professional competence and skills in accordance with Standards on Auditing. Audit procedures are applied in accordance with SAs, audit evidence is obtained and evaluated. On basis of that, conclusions are drawn and opinion is formed. It leads to high level of assurance which is called as reasonable assurance but it is not absolute assurance.\\nMisstatements in financial statements can occur due to fraud or error or both. The auditor seeks to obtain reasonable assurance whether financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements caused by fraud or error. He has to see effect of misstatements on financial statements as a whole, in totality.\\nObtaining reasonable assurance that financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements enables the auditor to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\nThe opinion is reported and communicated in accordance with audit findings through a written report as required by Standards on Auditing.

The purpose of an audit is to enhance the degree of confidence of intended users in the financial statements. Users of financial statements may be shareholders, employees, customers, government and regulatory authorities, bankers etc. Enhancing of degree of confidence is achieved by the expression of an opinion by the auditor on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n(Applicable financial reporting framework means a framework adopted in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that is acceptable in view of the nature of the entity and the objective of the financial statements, or that is required by law or regulation.)\\nFor example, in case of companies in India, financial reporting framework is provided under Schedule III of Companies Act,2013.\\n\\nThe following points are included in scope of audit of financial statements: -\\nCoverage of all aspects of entity\\nAudit of financial statements should be organized adequately to cover all aspects of the entity relevant to the financial statements being audited.\\nReliability and sufficiency of financial information\\nThe auditor should be reasonably satisfied that information contained in underlying accounting records and other source data (like bills, vouchers, documents etc.) is reliable and sufficient basis for preparation of financial statements.\\nThe auditor makes a judgment of reliability and sufficiency of financial information by making a study and assessment of accounting systems and internal controls and by carrying out appropriate tests, enquiries and procedures.\\nProper disclosure of financial information\\nThe auditor should also decide whether relevant information is properly disclosed in the financial statements. He should also keep in mind applicable statutory requirements in this regard.\\nIt is done by ensuring that financial statements properly summarize transactions and events recorded therein and by considering the judgments made by management in preparation of financial statements.\\nThe management responsible for preparation and presentation of financial statements makes many judgments in this process of preparing and presenting financial statements. For example, choosing of appropriate accounting policies in relation to various accounting issues like choosing method of charging depreciation on fixed assets or choosing appropriate method for valuation of inventories.\\nThe auditor evaluates selection and consistent application of accounting policies by management; whether such a selection is proper and whether chosen policy has been applied consistently on a period-to-period basis.\\nUnderstand that financial statements of an entity are prepared on historical financial information basis. \"Historical financial information\" means information expressed in financial terms in relation to a particular entity, derived primarily from that entity\\'s accounting system, about economic events occurring in past time periods or about economic conditions or circumstances at points in time in the past.\\nFor example, when purchases and sales are reflected in financial statements of an entity, these are examples of historical financial information. These are about transactions which have occurred in past.\\nSince financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical financial information, it is logical that audit of financial statements is also based upon such historical financial information.

These judgments may involve subjective decisions or a degree of uncertainty. Therefore, auditor may not be able to obtain absolute assurance that financial statements are free from material misstatements due to frauds or errors.\\nOne of the premises for conducting an audit is that management acknowledges its responsibility of preparation of financial statements in accordance with applicable financial reporting framework and for devising suitable internal controls. However, such controls may not have operated to produce reliable financial information due to their own limitations.\\nConsider, for example, that management of a company has devised a control that all purchase bills should reflect stamp and signatures of an authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" of the company stating the date and time of receiving goods in premises. It is an example of internal control devised by the company to ensure that only those purchase bills are produced for payment for which goods have been actually received. Now, what happens if concerned accountant and authorised person in \"Goods Receiving Section\" collude. It is a case of overriding of internal controls devised by the company due to collusion between two persons. Such a probable collusion is one of limitations of internal controls itself.'}\n",

There is no way by which auditor can force management to provide complete information as may be requested by auditor. In case he is not provided with required information, he can only report. It is an example of legal limitation on auditor's ability to obtain audit evidence.\\nThe management may consist of dishonest and unscrupulous people and may be, itself, involved in fraud. It may be engaged in concealing fraud by designing sophisticated and carefully organized schemes which may be hard to detect by the auditor. It may produce fabricated documents before auditor to lead him to believe that audit evidence is valid. However, in reality, such documents could be fake or non-genuine.\\nWe have already discussed under section on scope of audit that an auditor is not an expert in authentication of documents. Therefore, he may be led to accept invalid audit evidence on the basis of unauthentic documents.\\nIt is quite possible that entity may have entered into some transactions with related parties. Such transactions may be only paper transactions and may not have actually occurred. The auditor may not be aware of such related party relationships or audit procedures may not be able to detect probable wrong doings in such transactions.\"}\n",

A practitioner is a person who provides the assurance. The term practitioner is broader than auditor. Audit is related to historical information whereas practitioner may provide assurance not necessarily related to historical financial information.\\nA responsible party is the party responsible for preparation of subject matter.\\nIntended users are the persons for whom an assurance report is prepared. These persons may use the report in making decisions.\\nAn appropriate subject matter\\nIt refers to the information to be examined by the practitioner. For example, financial information contained in financial statements while conducting audit of financial statements.\\nSuitable criteria\\nThese refer to benchmarks used to evaluate the subject matter like standards, guidance, laws, rules and regulations.\\nSufficient appropriate evidence\\nThe practitioner performs an assurance engagement to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence. It is on the basis of evidence that conclusions are arrived and an opinion is formed by auditor.\\n\"Sufficient\" relates to quantity of evidence obtained by auditor. \"Appropriate\" relates to quality of evidence obtained by auditor. One evidence may be providing more comfort to auditor than the other evidence. The evidence providing more comfort is qualitative and, therefore, appropriate. Evidence should be both sufficient and appropriate.\\nA written assurance report in appropriate form\\nA written report is provided containing conclusion that conveys the assurance about the subject matter. A written assurance report is the outcome of an assurance engagement.\\nOverview of Elements of assurance engagement\\n- An assurance engagement involves a three-party relationship consisting of the responsible party, the practitioner, and the intended users.\\n- The subject matter of an assurance engagement must be appropriate, meaning it is capable of evaluation against suitable criteria and available for the practitioner to obtain evidence.\\n- Suitable criteria are standards or benchmarks applied to the subject matter of the assurance engagement against which the practitioner evaluates the information.\\n- Sufficient appropriate evidence is necessary to support the practitioner\\'s conclusion and is obtained through the assurance engagement process.\\n- A written assurance report is provided in an appropriate form to communicate the conclusion of the assurance engagement to its intended users.'}\n",

It provides reasonable assurance. However, review is a limited assurance engagement. It provides lower level of assurance than audit. Further, review involves fewer procedures and gathers sufficient appropriate evidence on the basis of which limited conclusions can be drawn up. However, both \"audit\" and \"review\" are related to financial statements prepared on the basis of historical financial information.'}\n",

The difference is of degree. Reasonable assurance engagement like audit provides reasonable assurance which is a high level of assurance. Limited assurance engagement like review provides lower level of assurance than audit. It is only a moderate level of assurance.\\n- Reasonable assurance engagement is a process that provides a high level of assurance through the performance of extensive procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence.\\n- In contrast, limited assurance engagement offers a lower level of assurance, performing fewer procedures than a reasonable assurance engagement.\\n- A reasonable assurance engagement results in conclusions based on the adequacy of the evidence gathered during the process.\\n- An example of reasonable assurance engagement is an audit, which involves a thorough examination and provides a high level of assurance.\\n- Conversely, an example of limited assurance engagement is a review, which provides a moderate level of assurance and involves less detailed procedures.\\nBesides reasonable assurance engagements and limited assurance engagements, there is another kind of assurance which is related to matters other than historical financial information. Such an assurance may relate to prospective financial information and not to historical financial information. It may relate to providing assurance on internal controls in an entity.\\n\"Prospective financial information\" means financial information based on assumptions about events that may occur in the future and possible actions by an entity. It can be in the form of a forecast or projection or combination of both.\\nIt is to be noted that in such type of assurance engagements, examination is not of historical financial information.\\nHere, it is important to note the difference between \"Historical financial information\" and \"Prospective financial information.\" The former relates to information expressed in financial terms of an entity about economic events, conditions or circumstances occurring in past periods. The latter relates to financial information based on assumptions about occurrence of future events and possible actions by an entity.\\nTherefore, historical financial information is rooted in past events which have already occurred whereas prospective financial information is related to future events.\\nIn assurance reports involving prospective financial information, the practitioner obtains sufficient appropriate evidence to the effect that management\\'s assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based are not unreasonable, the prospective financial information is properly prepared on the basis of the assumptions and it is properly presented and all material assumptions are adequately disclosed.\\nProspective financial information relates to future events. While evidence may be available to support the assumptions on which the prospective financial information is based, such evidence is itself generally future- oriented. The auditor is, therefore, not in a position to express an opinion as to whether the results shown in the prospective financial information will be achieved.\\nTherefore, in such assurance engagements, practitioner provides a report assuring that nothing has come to practitioner\\'s attention to suggest that these assumptions do not provide a reasonable basis for the projection.\\nHence, such type of assurance engagement provides only a \"moderate\" level of assurance.\\nExamples of assurance engagements\\n- An audit of financial statements is classified as a reasonable assurance engagement, aiming to provide a high assurance level that financial statements are free from material misstatement.\\n- A review of financial statements is considered a limited assurance engagement, which offers a moderate assurance level that no material modifications need to be made to the financial statements.\\n- The examination of prospective financial information is an assurance engagement that assesses the reasonableness of assumptions used in projections and related matters.\\n- Reporting on controls operating at an organization is an assurance engagement that evaluates the design and operation of an organization’s controls.\\nThe various categories of assurance engagements, which are professional services typically provided by certified accountants. The three main branches, originating from the overarching category of \"Assurance Engagements.\" Each branch is detailed below:\\n\\nReasonable Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis branch represents a high level of assurance provided by the auditor or accountant. It bifurcates into one sub-category:\\n\\nAudit: This is a type of reasonable assurance engagement where the auditor expresses an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.\\n\\nLimited Assurance Engagement:\\n\\nThis type of engagement provides a moderate level of assurance, less than that of a reasonable assurance engagement, but more than the level of assurance that would be provided by a compilation. It has one sub-category:\\n\\nReview: A review engagement is where the accountant performs procedures, primarily consisting of making inquiries of management and performing analytical procedures, to express a conclusion that provides a limited level of assurance on the financial statements.\\n\\nAssurance Engagements dealing with matters other than historical financial information:\\n\\nThis branch indicates assurance services that do not focus on historical financial data. It includes:\\n\\nExamination of prospective financial information (like forecast): This involves engagements where auditors evaluate the preparation and presentation of financial forecasts and projections.\\n\\nAssurance regarding operations of controls: Here, the assurance practitioner provides an opinion on the design, implementation, and/or effectiveness of the controls at a service organization.\\n\\nEach of these branches indicates a different scope of work, level of assurance, and purpose within the realm of assurance engagements, offering various options depending on the needs of the users of the financial information.'}\n",
